I\'m ___ years old it's getting cold I\'ve got my big coat on,5
But I miss screaming and crying and kissing in the rain,It\'s 2AM and I\'m cursing your name
You cry but you don\'t tell anyone,that you might not be the golden one
I see your face in my mind as I drive away,Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
