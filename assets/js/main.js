  const lyrics = "He said the way my blue eyes shined\nPut those Georgia stars to shame that night\nI said, 'That's a lie.'\nJust a boy in a Chevy truck\nThat had a tendency of gettin' stuck\nOn back roads at night\nAnd I was right there beside him all summer long\nAnd then the time we woke up to find that summer gone\nBut when you think Tim McGraw\nI hope you think my favorite song\nThe one we danced to all night long\nThe moon like a spotlight on the lake\nWhen you think happiness\nI hope you think that little black dress\nThink of my head on your chest\nAnd my old faded blue jeans\nWhen you think Tim McGraw\nI hope you think of me\nSeptember saw a month of tears\nAnd thankin' God that you weren't here\nTo see me like that\nBut in a box beneath my bed\nIs a letter that you never read\nFrom three summers back\nIt's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet\nAnd lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe\nWhen you think Tim McGraw\nI hope you think my favorite song\nThe one we danced to all night long\nThe moon like a spotlight on the lake\nWhen you think happiness\nI hope you think that little black dress\nThink of my head on your chest\nAnd my old faded blue jeans\nWhen you think Tim McGraw\nI hope you think of me\nAnd I'm back for the first time since then\nI'm standin' on your street\nAnd there's a letter left on your doorstep\nAnd the first thing that you'll read is:\nWhen you think Tim McGraw\nI hope you think my favorite song\nSomeday you'll turn your radio on\nI hope it takes you back to that place\nWhen you think happiness\nI hope you think that little black dress\nThink of my head on your chest\nAnd my old faded blue jeans\nWhen you think Tim McGraw\nI hope you think of me\nHe said the way my blue eyes shined\nPut those Georgia stars to shame that night\nI said, 'That's a lie.'\n--\nState the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy\nI realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me\nSo go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy\nThat's fine you won't mind if I say\nBy the way...\nI hate that stupid old pickup truck\nYou never let me drive\nYou're a redneck heartbreak\nWho's really bad at lying\nSo watch me strike a match\nOn all my wasted time\nAs far as I'm concerned you're\nJust another picture to burn!\nThere's no time for tears,\nI'm just sitting here planning my revenge\nThere's nothing stopping me\nFrom going out with all of your best friends\nAnd if you come around saying sorry to me\nMy daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be\nAnd if you're missing me,\nYou'd better keep it to yourself\n'Cause coming back around here\nWould be bad for your health...\n'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck\nYou never let me drive\nYou're a redneck heartbreak\nWho's really bad at lying\nSo watch me strike a match\nOn all my wasted time\nIn case you haven't heard,\nI really really hate that...\nBurn, burn, burn, baby, burn\nYou're just another picture to burn\nBaby, burn...\n---\nDrew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see\nThat I want and I'm needing everything that we should be\nI'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about,\nAnd she's got everything that I have to live without.\nDrew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's just so funny\nThat I can't even see anyone when he's with me\nHe says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,\nI wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night\nHe's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar\nThe only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star\nHe's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do\nDrew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?\nAnd there he goes, so perfectly,\nThe kind of flawless I wish I could be\nShe better hold him tight, give him all her love\nLook in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause\nSo I drive home alone.\nAs I turn out the light\nI'll put his picture down\nAnd maybe get some sleep tonight.\n'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar\nThe only one who's got enough of me to break my heart\nHe's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do\nHe's the time taken up, but there's never enough\nAnd he's all that I need to fall into.\nDrew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see.\n---\nI don't know what I want, so don't ask me\nCause I'm still trying to figure it out\nDon't know what's down this road, I'm just walking\nTrying to see through the rain coming down\nEven though I'm not the only one\nWho feels the way I do\nI'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know\nI'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on\nOh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world\nGot the radio on, my old blue jeans\nAnd I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve\nFeeling lucky today, got the sunshine\nCould you tell me what more do I need\nAnd tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah\nBut that's ok\nMaybe Im just a girl on a mission\nBut I'm ready to fly\nI'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know\nI'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on\nOh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know\nOh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world\n---\nYou have a way of coming easily to me\nAnd when you take, you take the very best of me\nSo I start a fight cause I need to feel something\nAnd you do what you want cause I'm not what you wanted\nOh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day\nJust walk away, no use defending words that you will never say\nAnd now that I'm sitting here thinking it through\nI've never been anywhere cold as you\nYou put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray\nAnd I stood there loving you and wished them all away\nAnd you come away with a great little story\nOf a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you\nYou never did give a damn thing honey but I cried, cried for you\nAnd I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you\nOh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day\nEvery smile you fake is so condescending\nCounting all the scars you made\nAnd now that I'm sitting here thinking it through\nI've never been anywhere cold as you\n---\nI didn't know what I would find\nWhen I went looking for a reason, I know\nI didn't read between the lines\nAnd, baby, I've got nowhere to go\nI tried to take the road less traveled by\nBut nothing seems to work the first few times\nAm I right?\nSo how can I ever try to be better?\nNobody ever lets me in\nI can still see you, this ain't the best view\nOn the outside looking in\nI've been a lot of lonely places\nI've never been on the outside\nYou saw me there, but never knew\nI would give it all up to be\nA part of this, a part of you\nAnd now it's all too late so you see\nYou could've helped if you had wanted to\nBut no one notices until it's too\nLate to do anything\nSo how can I ever try to be better?\nNobody ever lets me in\nI can still see you, this ain't the best view\nOn the outside looking in\nI've been a lot of lonely places\nI've never been on the outside\n---\nCory's eyes are like a jungle\nHe smiles, it's like the radio\nHe whispers songs into my window\nIn words that nobody knows\nThere's pretty girls on every corner\nThat watch him as he's walking home\nSaying, 'Does he know?'\nWill you ever know?\nYou're beautiful\nEvery little piece love,\nAnd don't you know\nYou're really gonna be someone,\nAsk anyone.\nAnd when you find everything you looked for\nI hope your life lead you back to my door\nOh, but if it don't,\nStay beautiful\nCory finds another way to be\nThe highlight of my day\nI'm taking pictures in my mind\nSo I can save them for a rainy day\nIt's hard to make a conversation\nWhen he's taking my breath away\nI should say, hey, by the way...\nIf you and I are a story\nThat never gets told\nIf what you are is a daydream\nI'll never get to hold,\nAt least you'll know...\nYou're beautiful\nEvery little piece love,\nAnd don't you know\nYou're really gonna be someone,\nAsk anyone.\nAnd when you find everything you looked for,\nI hope your life lead you back to my front door.\nOh, but if it don't\nWill you stay\nBeautiful, beautiful, beautiful\nBeautiful, beautiful, beautiful\n---\nIt's strange to think the songs we used to sing\nThe smiles, the flowers, everything is gone\nYesterday I found out about you\nEven now just looking at you feels wrong\nYou say that you'd take it all back, given one chance\nIt was a moment of weakness and you said, 'Yes.'\nYou should've said 'No', you should've gone home\nYou should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go\nYou should've known that word, with what you did with her,\nGet back to me (get back to me).\nAnd I should've been there in the back of your mind\nI shouldn't be asking myself, 'Why?'\nYou shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...\nYou should've said 'No', baby, and you might still have me\nYou can see that I've been crying\nBaby, you know all the right things to say\nBut do you honestly expect me to believe\nWe could ever be the same?\nYou say that the past is the past, you need one chance\nIt was a moment of weakness and you said, 'Yes.'\nI can't resist\nBefore you go, tell me this:\nWas it worth it?\nWas she worth this?\nNo... no, no, no...\n---\nShe said, I was seven and you were nine\nI looked at you like the stars that shined\nIn the sky, the pretty lights\nAnd our daddies used to joke about the two of us\nGrowing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled\nAnd rolled their eyes and said oh my my my\nTake me back to the house in the backyard tree\nSaid you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me\nYou never did, you never did\nTake me back when our world was one block wide\nI dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried\nJust two kids, you and I... Oh my my my my\nWell, I was sixteen when suddenly\nI wasn't that little girl you used to see\nBut your eyes still shined like pretty lights\nAnd our daddies used to joke about the two of us\nThey never believed we'd really fall in love\nAnd our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes\nAnd said oh my my my...\nTake me back to the creek beds we turned up\nTwo A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me\nTake me back to the time we had our very first fight\nThe slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight\nYou stayed outside till the morning light Oh my my my my\nA few years had gone and come around\nWe were sitting at our favorite spot in town\nAnd you looked at me, got down on one knee\nTake me back to the time when we walked down the aisle\nOur whole town came and our mamas cried\nYou said I do and I did too\nTake me home where we met so many years before\nWe'll rock our babies on that very front porch\nAfter all this time, you and I\nI'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine\nI'll still look at you like the stars that shine\nIn the sky, oh my my my...\n---\nI was riding shotgun\nWith my hair undone\nIn the front seat of his car\nHe's got a one-hand feel\nOn the steering wheel\nThe other on my heart\nI look around, turn the radio down\nHe says, 'Baby is something wrong?'\nI say, 'Nothing,\nI was just thinking\nHow we don't have a song'\nAnd he says...\nOur song is the slamming screen door,\nSneakin' out late, tapping on your window\nWhen we're on the phone and you talk real slow\n'cause it's late and your mama don't know\nOur song is the way you laugh\nThe first date: 'Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have'\nAnd when I got home ... 'fore I said amen\nAsking God if he could play it again\nI was walking up\nThe front porch steps\nAfter everything that day\nHad gone all wrong\nAnd been trampled on\nAnd lost and thrown away\nGot to the hallway,\nWell on my way\nTo my lovin' bed\nI almost didn't notice\nAll the roses\nAnd the note that said...\nOur song is the slamming screen door,\nSneakin' out late, tapping on your window\nWhen we're on the phone and you talk real slow\n'cause it's late and your mama don't know\nOur song is the way you laugh\nThe first date: 'Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have'\nAnd when I got home ... 'fore I said amen\nAsking God if he could play it again\nI've heard every album, listened to the radio\nWaited for something to come along\nThat was as good as our song...\n'Cause our song is the slamming screen door,\nSneakin' out late, tapping on his window\nWhen we're on the phone and he talks real slow\n'cause it's late and his mama don't know\nOur song is the way he laughs\nThe first date: 'Man, I didn't kiss him, when I should have'\nAnd when I got home ... 'fore I said amen\nAsking God if he could play it again\nPlay it again\nI was riding shotgun\nWith my hair undone\nIn the front seat of his car\nI grabbed a pen\nAnd an old napkin\nAnd I wrote down our song\n---\nFriday night beneath the stars,\nin a field behind your yard,\nyou and I are paintin' pictures in the sky.\nAnd sometimes we don't say a thing;\njust listen to the crickets sing.\nEverything I need is right here by my side.\nAnd I know everything about you\nI don't wanna live without you.\nI'm only up when you're not down.\nDon't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.\nIt's like no matter what I do.\nWell you drive me crazy half the time;\nthe other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true.\nAnd I'm only me when I'm with you.\nJust a small town boy and girl\nlivin' in a crazy world.\nTryin' to figure out what is and isn't true.\nAnd I don't try to hide my tears.\nThe secrets or my deepest fears.\nThrough it all nobody gets me like you do.\nAnd you know everything about me.\nYou say that you can't live without me.\nWhen I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself.\nOnly you can tell.\nThat I'm only up when you're not down.\nDon't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.\nIt's like no matter what I do.\nWell you drive me crazy half the time;\nthe other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true.\nAnd I'm only me\nWho I wanna be\nWell, I'm only me when I'm with you\n---\nShe cant see the way your eyes\nLight up when you smile.\nShell never notice how you stop and stare\nWhenever she walks by.\nAnd you cant see me wantin' you the way you want her\nBut you are everything to me.\nI just wanna show you\nShe dont even know you,\nShe's never gonna love you like I want to.\nAnd you just see right through me.\nIf you only knew me\nWe could be a beautiful miracle, \nUnbelievable Instead of just invisible.\nTheres a fire inside of you\nThat cant help but shine through.\nShes never gonna see the light\nNo matter what you do.\nAnd all I think about is how to make you think of me\nAnd everything that we could be\nLike shadows in a faded light\nOh, were invisible.\nI just wanna open your eyes\nAnd make you realize.\nI just wanna show you\nShe dont even know you.\nBaby, let me love you,\nLet me want you.\nYou just see right through me\nBut if you only knew me\nWe could be a beautiful miracle,\nUnbelievable, instead of just invisible.\nShe cant see the way your eyes\nLight up when you smile.\n---\nWhy would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?\nWhy would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?\nWhy would you wanna make the very first scar?\nWhy would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?\nMaybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall.\nAnd realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall.\nNo matter what you say, I still can't believe\nThat you would walk away.\nIt don't make sense to me, but:\nWhy would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?\nWhy would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?\nWhy would you wanna make the very first scar?\nWhy would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?\nIt's not unbroken anymore.\nHow do I get it back the way it was before?\nWhy would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?\nWhy would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?\nWhy would you wanna make the very first scar?\nWhy would you wanna break, would you wanna break a:\nWhy would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?\nWhy would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?\nWhy would you wanna make the very first scar?\nWhy would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?\n---\nI like the way you sound in the morning\nWe're on the phone and without a warning\nI

eye\nAnd we caught onto something\nI hold onto the night\nYou looked me in the eye and told me you loved me\nWere you just kidding cause it seems to me\nThis thing is breaking down, we almost never speak\nI don't feel welcome anymore\nBaby, what happened, please tell me\nCause one second it was perfect\nNow you're half way out the door\nAnd I stare at the phone\nHe still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low\nYou can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to\nWhen he said forever and always\nOh, and it rains in your bedroom\nEverything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here\nAnd it rains when you're gone\nI was there when you said forever and always\nWas I out of line?\nDid I say something way too honest?\nMade you run and hide like a scared little boy\nI looked into your eyes\nThought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure\nSo here's to everything coming down to nothing\nHere's to silence that cuts me to the core\nWhere is this going?\nThought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore\nAnd I stare at the phone\nHe still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low\nYou can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to\nWhen he said forever and always\nAnd it rains in

see your face\nAnd I knew from the first note played\nI'd be breaking all my rules to see you\nYou smile that beautiful smile and\nAll the girls in the front row scream your name\nSo dim that spotlight, tell me things like\nI can't take my eyes off of you\nI'm no one special, just another\nWide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you\nGive me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar\nGood morning loneliness, comes around when I'm not\nDreaming about you\nWhen my world wakes up today\nYou'll be in another town\nAnd I knew when I saw your face, I'd be\nCounting down the ways to see you\nYou smile that beautiful smile and\nAll the girls in the front row scream your name\nSo dim that spotlight, tell me things like\nI can't take my eyes off of you\nI'm no one special, just another\nWide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you\nGive me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar\nYou played in bars, you play guitar\nI'm invisible and everyone knows who you are\nAnd you'll never see, sing me to sleep\nEvery night from the radio\nSo dim that spotlight, tell me things like\nI can't take my eyes off of you\nI'm no one special, just another\nWide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you\nGive me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar\nSweet, sweet superstar, superstar\n---\nIn the heat of the fight I walked away\nIgnoring words that you were saying\nTrying to make me stay\nI said, 'This time I've had enough.'\nAnd you've called a hundred times\nBut I'm not picking up\n'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over\nBut if you look a little closer\nI said, 'Leave,' but all I really want is you\nTo stand outside my window throwing pebbles\nScreaming, 'I'm in love with you.'\nWait there in the pouring rain, come back for more\nAnd don't you leave 'cause I know\nAll I need is on the other side of the door\nMe and my stupid pride are sitting here alone\nGoing through the photographs, staring at the phone\nI keep going back over things we both said\nAnd I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread\nSo babe if you know everything, tell me why you couldn't see\nWhen I left I wanted you to chase after me\nYeah, I said, 'Leave,' but all I really want is you\nTo stand outside my window throwing pebbles\nScreaming, 'I'm in love with you.'\nWait there in the pouring rain, come back for more\nAnd don't you leave 'cause I know\nAll I need is on the other side of the door\nAnd I'll scream out the window\nI can't even look at you\nI don't need you but I do, I do, I do\nI say, 'There's nothing you can say to make this right again.\nI mean it, I mean it.'\nWhat I mean is...\nI said, 'Leave,' but baby all I want is you\nTo stand outside my window throwing pebbles\nScreaming, 'I'm in love with you.'\nWait there in the pouring rain, come back for more\nAnd don't you leave 'cause I know\nAll I need is on the other side of the door\nWith your face and the beautiful eyes\nAnd the conversation with the little white lies\nAnd the faded picture of a beautiful night\nYou carry me from your car up the stairs\nAnd I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?\nAfter everything and that little black dress\nAfter everything I must confess, I need you\n---\nThere's somethin' 'bout the way\nThe street looks when it's just rained\nThere's a glow off the pavement\nYou walk me to the car\nAnd you know I wanna ask you to dance right there\nIn the middle of the parking lot yeah\nWe're drivin' down the road\nI wonder if you know\nI'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now\nBut you're just so cool\nRun your hands through your hair\nAbsent-mindedly makin' me want you \nAnd I don't know how it gets better than this\nYou take my hand and drag me head first\nFearless\nAnd I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress Fearless\nSo, baby, drive slow\n'Til we run out of road in this one horse town\nI wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat\nYou put your eyes on me\nIn this moment now capture it, remember it \n'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this\nYou take my hand and drag me head first Fearless\nAnd I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress Fearless \nWell, you stood there with me in the doorway\nMy hands shake I'm not usually this way\nBut you pull me in and I'm a little more brave\nIt's the first kiss,\nIt's flawless,\nReally something,\nIt's fearless.\n'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this\nYou take my hand and drag me head first\nFearless\nAnd I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress Fearless\n'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this\nYou take my hand and drag me head first Fearless\nAnd I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress Fearless\n---\nYou take a deep breath and you walk through the doors\nIt's the morning of your very first day\nYou say 'Hi' to your friends you ain't seen in a while\nTry and stay out of everybody's way\nIt's your freshman year and you're gonna be here\nFor the next four years in this town\nHoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say,\n'You know I haven't seen you around before.'\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen\nFeeling like there's nothing to figure out\nWell count to ten, take it in\nThis is life before you know who you're gonna be Fifteen\nYou sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail\nAnd soon enough you're best friends\nLaughing at the other girls who think they're so cool\nWe'll be out of here as soon as we can\nAnd then you're on your very first date and he's got a car\nAnd you're feeling like flying\nAnd you're momma's waiting up and you think he's the one\nAnd you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends\nWhen the night ends\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nWhen you're fifteen and your first kiss\nMakes your head spin round but\nIn your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy of the football team\nBut I didn't know it at fifteen\nWhen all you wanted was to be wanted\nWish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now\nBack then I swore I was gonna marry him someday\nBut I realized some bigger dreams of mine\nAnd Abigail gave everything she had to a boy\nWho changed his mind and we both cried\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall\nI've found that time can heal most anything\nAnd you just might find who you're supposed to be\nI didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen\nYour very first day\nTake a deep breath, girl\nTake a deep breath as you walk through the doors.\n---\nWe were both young when I first saw you.\nI close my eyes and the flashback starts:\nI'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.\nSee the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.\nSee you make your way through the crowd\nAnd say, 'Hello, '\nLittle did I know...\nThat you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles,\nAnd my daddy said, 'Stay away from Juliet'\nAnd I was crying on the staircase\nBegging you, 'Please don't go'\nAnd I said...\nRomeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.\nI'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.\nYou'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,\nIt's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'.\nSo I sneak out to the garden to see you.\nWe keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew\nSo close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.\n'Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,\nAnd my daddy said, 'Stay away from Juliet'\nBut you were everything to me,\nI was begging you, 'Please don't go'\nAnd I said...\nRomeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.\nI'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.\nYou'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.\nIt's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'.\nRomeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.\nThis love is difficult but it's real.\nDon't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.\nIt's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'.\nI got tired of waiting\nWondering if you were ever coming around.\nMy faith in you was fading\nWhen I met you on the outskirts of town.\nAnd I said...\nRomeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone.\nI keep waiting for you but you never come.\nIs this in my head? I don't know what to think.\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...\nMarry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.\nI love you, and that's all I really know.\nI talked to your dad - go pick out a white dress\nIt's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'.\n'Cause we were both young when I first saw you\n---\nHey Stephen,\nI know looks can be deceiving\nBut I know I saw a light in you.\nAnd as we walked we were talking \nI didn't say half the things I wanted to.\nOf all the girls tossing rocks at your window\nI'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold.\nHey Stephen,\nBoy, you might have me believing\nI don't always have to be alone.\n'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel,\nCan't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.\nSo come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.\nCan't help it if there's no one else.\nMmm, I can't help myself.\nHey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling.\nSo I've got some things to say to you, ha.\nI seen it all \nSo I thought \nBut I never seen nobody shine the way you do.\nThe way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name \nIt's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change.\nHey Stephen, Why are people always leaving?\nI think you and I should stay the same.\nThey're dimming the street lights.\nYou're perfect for me, why aren't you here tonight?\nI'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out and pull me near to shine, shine, shine.\nHey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons\nWhy I should be the one you choose.\nAll those other girls \nWell, they're beautiful\nBut would they write a song for you?\nI can't help it if you look like an angel,\nCan't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.\nSo come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.\nCan't help it if there's no one else.\nMmm, I can't help myself...\n...if you look like an angel.\nCan't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.\nSo come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.\nCan't help it if there's no one else.\nMmm, I can't help myself.\nI can't help myself.\n---\nSay you're sorry\nThat face of an angel\nComes out just when you need it to\nAs I paced back and forth all this time\n'Cause I honestly believed in you\nHolding on. The days drag on\nStupid girl,\nI should have known, I should have known\nThat I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,\nI'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,\nLead her up the stairwell\nThis ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,\nI was a dreamer before you went and let me down,\nNow it's too late for you and your white horse to come around\nMaybe I was naive,\nGot lost in your eyes\nAnd never really had a chance\nMy mistake, I didn't know to be in love\nYou had to fight to have the upper hand\nI had so many dreams\nAbout you and me, happy endings, now I know\nThat I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,\nI'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,\nLead her up the stairwell\nThis ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,\nI was a dreamer before you went and let me down,\nNow it's too late for you and your white horse to come around\nAnd there you are on your knees,\nBegging for forgiveness, begging for me\nJust like I always wanted but I'm so sorry\n'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale,\nI'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well\nThis is a big world, that was a small town\nThey're in my rear view mirror disappearing now\nAnd it's too late for you and your white horse\nNow it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now\n---\nYou're on the phone with your girlfriend\nShe's upset, she's going off about something that you said\n'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.\nI'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.\nI'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.\nAnd she'll never know your story like I do.\nBut she wears short skirts\nI wear t-shirts\nShe's cheer captain\nAnd I'm on the bleachers\nDreaming about the day when you wake up and find\nThat what you're looking for has been here the whole time.\nIf you could see\nThat I'm the one\nWho understands you.\nBeen here all along.\nSo, why can't you see\nYou belong with me,\nYou belong with me.\nWalk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans\nI can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.\nLaughing on a park bench thinking to myself,\n'Hey, isn't this easy?'\nAnd you've got a smile\nThat could light up this whole town.\nI haven't seen it in a while\nSince she brought you down.\nYou say you're fine I know you better than that.\nHey, what you doing with a girl like that?\nShe wears high heels,\nI wear sneakers.\nShe's cheer captain,\nAnd I'm on the bleachers.\nDreaming about the day when you wake up and find\nThat what you're looking for has been here the whole time.\nIf you could see\nThat I'm the one\nWho understands you,\nBeen here all along.\nSo, why can't you see\nYou belong with me.\nStanding by and waiting at your backdoor.\nAll this time how could you not know, baby?\nYou belong with me,\nYou belong with me.\nOh, I remember you driving to my house\nIn the middle of the night.\nI'm the one who makes you laugh\nWhen you know you're 'bout to cry.\nI know your favorite songs,\nAnd you tell me about your dreams.\nThink I know where you belong,\nThink I know it's with me.\nCan't you see that I'm the one\nWho understands you?\nBeen here all along. So, why can't you see\nYou belong with me.\nStanding by and waiting at your backdoor.\nAll this time how could you not know, baby?\nYou belong with me,\nHave you ever thought just maybe\nYou belong with me?\n---\nI see your face in my mind as I drive away,\nCause none of us thought it was gonna end that way.\nPeople are people, and sometimes we change our minds.\nBut it's killing me to see you go after all this time.\nMusic starts playin' like the end of a sad movie,\nIt's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see.\nCause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down,\nNow I don't know what to be without you around.\nAnd we know it's never simple, never easy.\nNever a clean break, no one here to save me.\nYou're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,\nAnd I can't breathe without you But I have to.\nBreathe without you But I have to.\nNever wanted this, never wanna see you hurt.\nEvery little bump in the road I tried to swerve.\nPeople are people, and sometimes it doesn't work out,\nNothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out.\nAnd we know it's never simple, never easy.\nNever a clean break, no one here to save me.\nYou're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,\nAnd I can't breathe without you\nBut I have to.\nBreathe without you\nBut I have to.\nIt's two A.M.\nFeelin' like I just lost a friend.\nHope you know it's not easy, easy for me.\nIt's two A.M.\nFeelin' like I just lost a friend.\nHope you know this ain't easy, easy for me.\nAnd we know it's never simple, never easy.\nNever a clean break, no one here to save me.\nAnd I can't breathe without you\nBut I have to. Breathe without you\nBut I have to. Breathe without you\nI'm sorry\n---\nI took a chance, I took a shot \nAnd you might think i'm bulletproof, but i'm not \nYou took a swing, I took it hard \nAnd down here from the ground I see who you are \nI'm sick and tired of your attitude \nI'm feeling like I don't know you \nYou tell me that you love me then you cut me down \nAnd I need you like a heartbeat \nBut you know you got a mean streak \nMakes me run for cover when you're around \nAnd here's to you and your temper \nYes, I remember what you said last night \nAnd I know that you see what you're doing to me \nTell me why.. \nYou could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day \nWell I get so confused and frustrated \nForget what i'm trying to say, oh \nI'm sick and tired of your reasons \nI got no one to believe in \nYou tell me that you want me, then push me around \nAnd I need you like a heartbeat \nBut you know you got a mean streak \nMakes me run for cover when you're around \nHere's to you and your temper \nYes, I remember what you said last night \nAnd I know that you see what you're doing to me \nTell me why.. \nWhy..do you have to make me feel small \nSo you can feel whole inside \nWhy..do you have to put down my dreams \nSo you're the only thing on my mind \nI'm sick and tired of your attitude \nI'm feeling like I don't know you \nYou tell me that you want me then cut me down \nI'm sick and tired of your reasons \nI've got no one to believe in \nYou ask me for my love then you push me around \nHere's to you and your temper \nYes, I remember what you said last night \nAnd I know that you see what you're doing to me \nTell me why \nI take a step back, let you go \nI told you i'm not bulletproof \nNow you know\n---\nAll this time I was wasting,\nHoping you would come around\nI've been giving out chances every time\nAnd all you do is let me down\nAnd it's taken me this long\nBaby but I figured you out\nAnd you're thinking we'll be fine again,\nBut not this time around\nYou don't have to call anymore\nI won't pick up the phone\nThis is the last straw\nDon't wanna hurt anymore\nAnd you can tell me that you're sorry\nBut I don't believe you baby\nLike I did before\nYou're not sorry, no no oh\nLooking so innocent,\nI might believe you if I didn't know\nCould've loved you all my life\nIf you hadn't left me waiting in the cold\nAnd you got your share of secrets\nAnd I'm tired of being last to know\nAnd now you're asking me to listen\nCause it's worked each time before\nBut you don't have to call anymore\nI won't pick up the phone\nThis is the last straw\nDon't wanna hurt anymore\nAnd you can tell me that you're sorry\nBut I don't believe you baby\nLike I did before\nYou're not sorry no no oh\nYou had me crying for you honey\nAnd it never would've gone away, no\nYou used to shine so bright\nBut I watched all of it fade\nSo you don't have to call anymore\nI won't pick up the phone\nThis is the last straw\nThere's nothing left to beg for\nAnd you can tell me that you're sorry\nBut I don't believe you baby\nLike I did before\nYou're not sorry, no no oh\nYou're not sorry, no no oh\n---\nHe is sensible and so incredible \nAnd all my single friends are jealous \nHe says everything I need to hear and it's like \nI couldn't ask for anything better \nHe opens up my door and I get into his car \nAnd he says you look beautiful tonight \nAnd I feel perfectly fine \nBut I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain \nAnd it's 2am and I'm cursing your name \nYou're so in love that you act insane \nAnd that's the way I loved you \nBreakin' down and coming undone \nIt's a roller coaster kinda rush \nAnd I never knew I could feel that much \nAnd that's the way I loved you \nHe respects my space \nAnd never makes me wait \nAnd he calls exactly when he says he will \nHe's close to my mother \nTalks business with my father \nHe's charming and endearing \nAnd I'm comfortable s\nBut I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain \nAnd it's 2am and I'm cursing your name \nYou're so in love that you act insane \nAnd that's the way I loved you \nBreakin' down and coming undone \nIt's a roller coaster kinda rush \nAnd I never knew I could feel that much \nAnd that's the way I loved you s\nHe can't see the smile I'm faking \nAnd my heart's not breaking \nCause I'm not feeling anything at all \nAnd you were wild and crazy \nJust so frustrating intoxicating \nComplicated, got away by some mistake and now s\nI miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain \nIt's 2am and I'm cursing your name \nI'm so in love that I acted insane \nAnd that's the way I loved you \nBreaking down and coming undone \nIt's a roller coaster kinda rush \nAnd I never knew I could feel that much \nAnd that's the way I loved you oh, oh s\nAnd that's the way I loved you oh, oh \nNever knew I could feel that much \nAnd that's the way I loved you\n---\nI'm five years old\nIt's getting cold\nI've got my big coat on\nI hear your laugh\nAnd look up smiling at you\nI run and run\nPast the pumpkin patch\nAnd the tractor rides\nLook now -- the sky is gold\nI hug your legs and fall asleep\nOn the way home\nI don't know why all the trees change in the fall\nI know you're not scared of anything at all\nDon't know if Snow White's house is near or far away\nBut I know I had the best day\nWith you today\nI'm thirteen now\nAnd don't know how my friends\nCould be so mean\nI come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys\nAnd we drive and drive\nUntil we've found a town\nFar enough away\nAnd we talk and window-shop\nUntil I've forgotten all their names\nI don't know who I'm gonna talk to\nNow at school\nI know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you\nDon't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay\nBut I know I had the best day\nWith you today\nI have an excellent father\nHis strength is making me stronger\nGod smiles on my little brother\nInside and out\nHe's better than I am\nI grew up in a pretty house\nAnd I had space to run\nAnd I had the best days with you\nThere is a video\nI found from back when I was three\nYou set up a paint set in the kitchen\nAnd you're talking to me\nIt's the age of princesses and pirate ships\nAnd the seven dwarfs\nDaddy's smart\nAnd you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world\nNow I know why all the trees change in the fall\nI know you were on my side\nEven when I was wrong\nAnd I love you for giving me your eyes\nStaying back and watching me shine\nAnd I didn't know if you knew\nSo I'm taking this chance to say\nThat I had the best day\nWith you today\n---\nAnd its a sad picture,\nThe final blow hits you\nSomebody else gets what you wanted again\nAnd you know its all the same,\nAnother time and place\nRepeating history and youre getting sick of it\nBut I believe in whatever you do\nAnd Ill do anything to see it through\nBecause these things will change\nCan you feel it now?\nThese walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down\nThis revolution, the time will come\nFor us to finally win\nAnd well sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah\nSo weve been outnumbered\nRaided and now cornered\nIts hard to fight when the fight aint fair\nWere getting stronger now\nFind things they never found\nThey might be bigger\nBut were faster and never scared\nYou can walk away, say we dont need this\nBut theres something in your eyes says we can beat this\n'Cause these things will change\nCan you feel it now?\nThese walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down\nThis revolution, the time will come\nFor us to finally win\nAnd well sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah\nTonight we'll stand, get off our knees\nFight for what weve worked for all these years\nAnd the battle was long, its the fight of our lives\nBut well stand up champions tonight\nIt was the night things changed\nCan you see it now?\nThese walls that they put up to hold us back fell down\nThis revolution, throw your hands up\n'Cause we never gave in\nAnd we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah\n---\nYou said, 'I know'\nWhen I said, 'I need some time, need some space\nTo think about all of this'\nYou watched me go\nAnd I knew my words were hard to

fallin\nWondering why we bother with love if it never lasts\nI say, 'Can you believe it?'\nAs were lying on the couch\nThe moment I can see it.\nYes, yes, I can see it now.\nDo you remember, we were sitting there by the water?\nYou put your arm around me for the first time.\nYou made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter.\nYou are the best thing thats ever been mine.\nFlash forward and were taking on the world together,\nAnd theres a drawer of my things at your place.\nYou learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded,\nYou say well never make my parents mistakes.\nBut we got bills to pay,\nWe got nothing figured out,\nWhen it was hard to take,\nYes, yes, this is what I thought about.\nDo you remember, we were sitting there by the water?\nYou put your arm around me for the first time\nYou made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter\nYou are the best thing thats ever been mine.\nDo you remember all the city lights on the water?\nYou saw me start to believe for the first time\nYou made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter\nYou are the best thing thats ever been mine.\nAnd I remember that fight\nTwo-thirty AM\nAs everything was slipping right out of our hands\nI ran out crying and you followed me out into the street\nBraced myself for the 'Goodbye.'\nCause thats all Ive ever known\nThen you took me by surprise\nYou said, 'Ill never leave you alone.'\nYou said, 'I remember how we felt sitting by the water.\nAnd every time I look at you, its like the first time.\nI fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter.\nShe is the best thing thats ever been mine.'\nYou made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter\nYou are the best thing thats ever been mine.\n(Hold on) do you believe it?\n(Hold on) we're gonna make it now.\n(Hold on) and I can see it,\n(Yes, yes) I can see it now (see it now, see it now...)\n---\nThe way you move is like a full-on rainstorm\nAnd I'm a house of cards\nYou're the kind of reckless\nThat should send me runnin'\nBut I kinda know that I won't get far\nAnd you stood there in front of me\nJust close enough to touch\nClose enough to hope you couldn't see\nWhat I was thinking of\nDrop everything now\nMeet me in the pouring rain\nKiss me on the sidewalk\nTake away the pain\n'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\nGet me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down\nGive me something that'll haunt me when you're not around\n'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\nMy mind forgets to remind me\nYou're a bad idea\nYou touch me once and it's really something,\nYou find I'm even better than you imagined I would be.\nI'm on my guard for the rest of the world\nBut with you I know it's no good\nAnd I could wait patiently but I really wish you would...\nDrop everything now\nMeet me in the pouring rain\nKiss me on the sidewalk\nTake away the pain\n'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\nGet me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down\nGive me something that'll haunt me when you're not around\n'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\nI'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild.\nJust keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right.\nAnd lead me up the staircase\nWon't you whisper soft and slow?\nI'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show.\nDrop everything now,\nMeet me in the pouring rain,\nKiss me on the sidewalk,\nTake away the pain\n'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile.\nGet me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down\nGive me something that'll haunt me when you're not around\n'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\nAnd the sparks fly...\nOh, baby, smile...\nAnd the sparks fly...\n---\nI'm so glad you made time to see me.\nHow's life? Tell me how's your family?\nI haven't seen them in a while.\nYou've been good, busier than ever,\nWe small talk, work and the weather,\nYour guard is up and I know why.\nBecause the last time you saw me\nIs still burned in the back of your mind.\nYou gave me roses and I left them there to die.\nSo this is me swallowing my pride,\nStanding in front of you saying, 'I'm sorry for that night,'\nAnd I go back to December all the time.\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.\nWishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.\nI'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.\nI go back to December all the time.\nThese days I haven't been sleeping,\nStaying up, playing back myself leavin'.\nWhen your birthday passed and I didn't call.\nAnd I think about summer, all the beautiful times,\nI watched you laughing from the passenger side.\nRealized I loved you in the fall.\nAnd then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind\nYou gave me all your love and all I gave you was 'Goodbye'.\nSo this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you saying, 'I'm sorry for that night.'\nAnd I go back to December all the time.\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,\nWishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.\nI'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\nI go back to December all the time.\nI miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile,\nSo good to me, so right\nAnd how you held me in your arms that September night\nThe first time you ever saw me cry.\nMaybe this is wishful thinking,\nProbably mindless dreaming,\nBut if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right.\nI'd go back in time and change it but I can't.\nSo if the chain is on your door I understand.\nBut this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you saying, 'I'm sorry for that night.'\nAnd I go back to December...\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,\nWishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.\nI'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.\nI'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\nI go back to December all the time.\n---\nI am not the kind of girl\nWho should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion\nBut you are not the kind of boy\nWho should be marrying the wrong girl\nI sneak in and see your friends\nAnd her snotty little family all dressed in pastel\nAnd she is yelling at a bridesmaid\nSomewhere back inside a room\nWearing a gown shaped like a pastry\nThis is surely not what you thought it would be\nI lose myself in a daydream\nWhere I stand and say\nDont say 'Yes', run away now\nIll meet you when youre out of the church at the back door\nDont wait or say a single vow\nYou need to hear me out\nAnd they said, 'Speak now.'\nFond gestures are exchanged\nAnd the organ starts to play\nA song that sounds like a death march\nAnd I am hiding in the curtains\nIt seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be\nShe floats down the aisle like a pageant queen\nBut I know you wish it was me,\nYou wish it was me, Dont you?\nDont say 'Yes', run away now,\nIll meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.\nDont wait or say a single vow,\nYou need to hear me out,\nAnd they said, 'Speak now.'\nDont say 'Yes', run away now,\nIll meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.\nDont wait or say a single vow,\nYour time is running out,\nAnd they said, 'Speak now.'\nI hear the preacher say, 'Speak now or forever hold your peace.'\nTheres the silence, theres my last chance.\nI stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me.\nHorrified looks from everyone in the room\nBut Im only looking at you.\nI am not the kind of girl\nWho should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion\nBut you are not the kind of boy\nWho should be marrying the wrong girl\nSo, dont say 'Yes', run away now,\nIll meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.\nDont wait or say a single vow,\nYou need to hear me out,\nAnd they said, 'Speak now.'\nAnd you say, 'Lets run away now,\nIll meet you when Im out of my tux at the back door.\nBaby, I didnt say my vows,\nSo glad you were around\nWhen they said, 'Speak now.'\n---\nLong were the nights when\nMy days once revolved around you\nCounting my footsteps\nPraying the floor wont fall through, again\nAnd my mother accused me of losing my mind\nBut I swore I was fine\nYou paint me a blue sky\nAnd go back and turn it to rain\nAnd I lived in your chess game\nBut you changed the rules everyday\nWonderin which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight\nWell I stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why\nDear John, I see it all now that you're gone.\nDon't you think I was too young\nTo be messed with?\nThe girl in the dress\nCried the whole way home, I should've known.\nWell maybe its me\nAnd my blind optimism to blame\nOr maybe its you and your sick need\nTo give love then take it away\nAnd you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand\nAnd I'll look back in regret how I ignored when they said,\n'Run as fast as you can.'\nDear John, I see it all now that you're gone.\nDon't you think I was too young\nTo be messed with?\nThe girl in the dress\nCried the whole way home\nDear John, I see it all now it was wrong\nDont you think nineteens too young\nTo be played by your dark, twisted games?\nWhen I loved you so, I should've known.\nYou are an expert at 'Sorry'\nAnd keeping lines blurry\nNever impressed by me acing your tests\nAll the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes\nCause you've burned them out\nBut I took your matches\nBefore fire could catch me\nSo dont look now\nIm shining like fireworks\nOver your sad empty town\nDear John, I see it all now that you're gone.\nDon't you think I was too young\nTo be messed with?\nThe girl in the dress\nCried the whole way home\nI see it all now that you're gone\nDon't you think I was too young\nTo be messed with?\nThe girl in the dress\nWrote you a song, you shouldve known.\nYou shouldve known\nDont you think I was too young?\nYou shouldve known.\n---\nYou, with your words like knives\nAnd swords and weapons that you use against me\nYou have knocked me off my feet again\nGot me feeling like a nothing\nYou, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard\nCalling me out when I'm wounded\nYou, picking on the weaker man\nWell you can take me down with just one single blow\nBut you don't know, what you don't know...\nSomeday I'll be living in a big ole city\nAnd all you're ever gonna be is mean\nSomeday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me\nAnd all you're ever gonna be is mean\nWhy you gotta be so mean?\nYou, with your switching sides\nAnd your wildfire lies and your humiliation\nYou have pointed out my flaws again\nAs if I don't already see them\nI walk with my head down\nTrying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress you\nI just wanna feel okay again\nI bet you got pushed around\nSomebody made you cold\nBut the cycle ends right now\n'Cause you can't lead me down that road\nAnd you don't know, what you don't know...\nSomeday I'll be living in a big ole city\nAnd all you're ever gonna be is mean\nSomeday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me\nAnd all you're ever gonna be is mean\nWhy you gotta be so mean?\nAnd I can see you years from now in a bar\nTalking over a football game\nWith that same big loud opinion\nBut nobody's listening\nWashed up and ranting about the same old bitter things\nDrunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing\nBut all you are is mean\nAll you are is mean\nAnd a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life\nAnd mean, and mean, and mean, and mean\nBut someday I'll be living in a big ole city\nAnd all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah\nSomeday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me\nAnd all you're ever gonna be is mean\nWhy you gotta be so?...\nSomeday I'll be living in a big ole city (Why you gotta be so?...)\nAnd all you're ever gonna be is mean (Why you gotta be so?...)\nSomeday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me (Why you gotta be so?...)\nAnd all you're ever gonna be is mean\nWhy you gotta be so mean?\n---\nI used to think one day we'd tell the story of us,\nHow we met and the sparks flew instantly,\nand people would say, 'They're the lucky ones.'\nI used to know my place was the spot next to you,\nNow I'm searching the room for an empty seat,\n'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on.\nOh, a simple complication,\nMiscommunications lead to fall-out.\nSo many things that I wish you knew,\nSo many walls up I can't break through.\nNow I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,\nAnd I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?\nI don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.\nNext chapter.\nHow'd we end up this way?\nSee me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy,\nAnd you're doing your best to avoid me.\nI'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us,\nHow I was losing my mind when I saw you here,\nBut you held your pride like you should've held me.\nOh, I'm scared to see the ending,\nWhy are we pretending this is nothing?\nI'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how,\nI've never heard silence quite this loud.\nNow I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,\nAnd I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?\nI don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.\nThis is looking like a contest,\nOf who can act like they care less,\nBut I liked it better when you were on my side.\nThe battle's in your hands now,\nBut I would lay my armor down\nIf you said you'd rather love than fight.\nSo many things that you wish I knew,\nBut the story of us might be ending soon.\nNow I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,\nAnd I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?\nI don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now.\nAnd we're not speaking,\nAnd I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?\nI don't know what to say, since the twist of fate 'cause we're going down,\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.\nThe end.\n---\nYour little hand's wrapped around my finger\nAnd it's so quiet in the world tonight\nYour little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming\nSo I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light\nTo you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret\nI'd give all I have, honey\nIf you could stay like that\nOh darling, don't you ever grow up\nDon't you ever grow up, just stay this little\nOh darling, don't you ever grow up\nDon't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple\nI won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart\nAnd no one will desert you\nJust try to never grow up, never grow up\nYou're in the car on the way to the movies\nAnd you're mortified your mom's dropping you off\nAt 14 there's just so much you can't do\nAnd you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots\nBut don't make her drop you off around the block\nRemember that she's getting older too\nAnd don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school\nOh darling, don't you ever grow up\nDon't you ever grow up, just stay this little\nOh darling, don't you ever grow up\nDon't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple\nNo one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred\nAnd even though you want to, just try to never grow up\nTake pictures in your mind of your childhood room\nMemorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home\nRemember the footsteps, remember the words said\nAnd all your little brother's favorite songs\nI just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone\nSo here I am in my new apartment\nIn a big city, they just dropped me off\nIt's so much colder than I thought it would be\nSo I tuck myself in and turn my night light on\nWish I'd never grown up\nI wish I'd never grown up\nOh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up\nI could still be little\nOh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up\nIt could still be simple\nOh darling, don't you ever grow up\nDon't you ever grow up, just stay this little\nOh darling, don't you ever grow up\nDon't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple\nWon't let nobody hurt you\nWon't let no one break your heart\nAnd even though you want to, please try to never grow up\nOh, don't you ever grow up\nOh, never grow up, just never grow up\n---\nThere I was again tonight\nForcing laughter, faking smiles\nSame old tired lonely place\nWalls of insincerity,\nShifting eyes and vacancy\nVanished when I saw your face\nAll I can say is it was enchanting to meet you\nYour eyes whispered, 'Have we met?'\nAcross the room your silhouette\nStarts to make its way to me\nThe playful conversation starts\nCounter all your quick remarks\nLike passing notes in secrecy\nAnd it was enchanting to meet you\nAll I can say is I was enchanted to meet you\nThis night is sparkling, don't you let it go\nI'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home\nI'll spend forever wondering if you knew\nI was enchanted to meet you\nThe lingering question kept me up\n2 AM, who do you love?\nI wonder 'til I'm wide awake\nAnd now I'm pacing back and forth\nWishing you were at my door\nI'd open up and you would say, 'Hey,\nIt was enchanting to meet you,\nAll I know is I was enchanted to meet you.'\nThis night is sparkling, don't you let it go\nI'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home\nI'll spend forever wondering if you knew\nThis night is flawless, don't you let it go\nI'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone\nI'll spend forever wondering if you knew\nI was enchanted to meet you\nThis is me praying that\nThis was the very first page\nNot where the story line ends\nMy thoughts will echo your name\nUntil I see you again\nThese are the words I held back\nAs I was leaving too soon\nI was enchanted to meet you\nPlease don't be in love with someone else\nPlease don't have somebody waiting on you\nPlease don't be in love with someone else\nPlease don't have somebody waiting on you\nThis night is sparkling, don't you let it go\nI'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home\nI'll spend forever wondering if you knew\nThis night is flawless, don't you let it go\nI'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone\nI'll spend forever wondering if you knew\nI was enchanted to meet you\nPlease don't be in love with someone else\nPlease don't have somebody waiting on you'\n---\nNow go stand in the corner and think about what you did'\nThe story starts when it was hot and it was summer and...\nI had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him\nShe came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause\nShe took him faster than you could say 'sabotage'\nI never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it\nI underestimated just who I was dealing with\nShe had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum\nShe underestimated just who she was stealing from\nShe's not a saint\nAnd she's not what you think\nShe's an actress, whoa\nShe's better known\nFor the things that she does\nOn the mattress, whoa\nSoon she's gonna find\nStealing other people's toys\nOn the playground won't\nMake you many friends\nShe should keep in mind She should keep in mind\nThere is nothing I do better than revenge\nShe looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list\nShe looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it\nI think her ever-present frown is a little troubling\nAnd she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things\nBut sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know\nOr pushing people down to get you where you wanna go\nThey wouldn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me\nBut no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity\nShe's not a saint\nAnd she's not what you think\nShe's an actress, whoa\nShe's better known\nFor the things that she does\nOn the mattress, whoa\nSoon she's gonna find\nStealing other people's toys\nOn the playground won't\nMake you many friends\nShe should keep in mind\nShe should keep in mind\nThere is nothing I do better than revenge\nI'm just another thing for you\nTo roll your eyes at, honey\nYou might have him but haven't you heard\nI'm just another thing for you\nTo roll your eyes at, honey\nYou might have him but I always get the last word Whoa\nShe's not a saint\nAnd she's not what you think\nShe's an actress, whoa\nShe's better known\nFor the things that she does\nOn the mattress, whoa\nSoon she's gonna find\nStealing other people's toys\nOn the playground won't\nMake you many friends\nShe should keep in mind\nShe should keep in mind\nThere is nothing I do better than revenge\nDo you still feel like you know what you're doing?\n'Cause I don't think you do. Oh.\nDo you still feel like you know what you're doing?\nI don't think you do\nI don't think you do\nLet's hear the applause\nCome on show me how much better you are (so much better, yeah)\nSo you deserve some applause 'cause you're so much better\nShe took him faster than you could say 'sabotage'\n---\nI guess you really did it this time\nLeft yourself in your warpath\nLost your balance on a tightrope\nLost your mind tryin' to get it back\nWasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?\nAlways a bigger bed to crawl into\nWasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything\nAnd everybody believed in you?\nIt's alright, just wait and see\nYour string of lights is still bright to me\nOh, who you are is not where you've been.\nYou're still an innocent.\nDid some things you can't speak of\nBut at night you live it all again\nYou wouldn't be shattered on the floor now\nIf only you had seen what you know now then\nWasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?\nWhen everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you\nWasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep\nBefore the monsters caught up to you?\nIt's alright, just wait and see\nYour string of lights is still bright to me\nOh, who you are is not what you've been\nYou're still an innocent\nIt's okay, life is a tough crowd\n32, and still growin' up now\nWho you are is not what you did.\nYou're still an innocent.\nTime turns flames to embers\nYou'll have new Septembers\nEvery one of us has messed up too\nMinds change like the weather\nI hope you remember\nToday is never too late to be brand new\nIt's alright, just wait and see\nYour string of lights is still bright to me\nOh, who you are is not what you've been\nYou're still an innocent.\nIt's okay, life is a tough crowd\n32, and still growin' up now\nWho you are is not what you did\nYou're still an innocent.\nLost your balance on a tightrope.\nIt's never too late to get it back.\n---\nYou and I walk a fragile line\nI have known it all this time\nBut I never thought I'd live to see it break\nIt's getting dark and it's all too quiet\nAnd I can't trust anything now\nAnd it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake\nOh, I'm holding my breath\nWon't lose you again\nSomething's made your eyes go cold\nCome on, come on, don't leave me like this\nI thought I had you figured out\nSomething's gone terribly wrong\nYou're all I wanted\nCome on, come on, don't leave me like this\nI thought I had you figured out\nCan't breathe whenever you're gone\nCan't turn back now, I'm haunted\nStood there and watched you walk away\nFrom everything we had\nBut I still mean every word I said to you\nHe will try to take away my pain\nAnd he just might make me smile\nBut the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead\nOh, I'm holding my breath\nWon't see you again\nSomething keeps me holding on to nothing\nCome on, come on, don't leave me like this\nI thought I had you figured out\nSomething's gone terribly wrong\nYou're all I wanted\nCome on, come on, don't leave me like this\nI thought I had you figured out\nCan't breathe whenever you're gone\nCan't turn back now, I'm haunted\nI know, I know, I just know\nYou're not gone. You can't be gone. No.\nCome on, come on, don't leave me like this\nI thought I had you figured out\nSomething's gone terribly wrong\nWon't finish what you started\nCome on, come on, don't leave me like this\nI thought I had you figured out\nCan't breathe whenever you're gone\nCan't go back, I'm haunted\nYou and I walk a fragile line\nI have known it all this time\nNever ever thought I'd see it break.\nNever thought I'd see it...\n---\nI still remember the look on your face\nLit through the darkness at 1:58\nThe words that you whispered\nFor just us to know\nYou told me you loved me\nSo why did you go away?\nI do recall now the smell of the rain\nFresh on the pavement\nI ran off the plane\nThat July 9th\nThe beat of your heart\nIt jumps through your shirt\nI can still feel your arms\nBut now I'll go sit on the floor\nWearing your clothes\nAll that I know is\nI don't know how to be something you miss\nI never thought we'd have a last kiss\nNever imagined we'd end like this\nYour name, forever the name on my lips\nI do remember the swing of your step\nThe life of the party, you're showing off again\nAnd I roll my eyes and then\nYou pull me in\nI'm not much for dancing\nBut for you I did\nBecause I love your handshake, meeting my father\nI love how you walk with your hands in your pockets\nHow you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something\nThere's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions\nAnd I'll go sit on the floor\nWearing your clothes\nAll that I know is\nI don't know how to be something you miss\nNever thought we'd have a last kiss\nNever imagined we'd end like this\nYour name, forever the name on my lips\nSo I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep\nAnd I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe\nAnd I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are\nHope it's nice where you are\nAnd I hope the sun shines\nAnd it's a beautiful day\nAnd something reminds you\nYou wish you had stayed\nYou can plan for a change in weather and time\nBut I never planned on you changing your mind\nSo I'll go sit on the floor\nWearing your clothes\nAll that I know is\nI don't know how to be something you miss\nNever thought we'd have a last kiss\nNever imagined we'd end like this\nYour name, forever the name on my lips\nJust like our last kiss\nForever the name on my lips\n---\nI said remember this moment in the back of my mind\nThe time we stood with our shaking hands\nThe crowds in stands went wild\nWe were the Kings and the Queens\nAnd they read off our names\nThe night you danced like you knew our lives\nWould never be the same\nYou held your head like a hero\nOn a history book page\nIt was the end of a decade\nBut the start of an age\nLong live the walls we crashed through\nHow the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\nI was screaming long live all the magic we made\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\nOne day, we will be remembered\nI said remember this feeling\nI pass the pictures around\nOf all the years that we stood there\nOn the side-lines wishing for right now\nWe are the Kings and the Queens\nYou traded your baseball cap for a crown\nWhen they gave us our trophies\nAnd we held them up for our town\nAnd the cynics were outraged\nScreaming, 'This is absurd!'\nCause for a moment a band of thieves\nIn ripped up jeans got to rule the world\nLong live the walls we crashed through\nHow the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\nI was screaming long live all the magic we made\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\nI'm not afraid\nLong live all the mountains we moved\nI had the time of my life fighting dragons with you\nI was screaming long live that look on your face\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\nOne day, we will be remembered\nHold on to spinning around\nConfetti falls to the ground\nMay these memories break our fall\nWill you take a moment, promise me this\nThat you'll stand by me forever\nBut if God forbid fate should step in\nAnd force us into a goodbye\nIf you have children some day\nWhen they point to the pictures\nPlease tell them my name\nTell them how the crowds went wild\nTell them how I hope they shine\nLong live the walls we crashed through\nI had the time of my life, with you\nLong, long live the walls we crashed through\nHow the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\nAnd I was screaming long live all the magic we made\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\nI'm not afraid\nSinging, long live all the mountains we moved\nI had the time of my life fighting dragons with you\nAnd long, long live the look on your face\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\nOne day, we will be remembered\n---\nElevator buttons and morning air\nStrangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs\nIf you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares\nBut right now my time is theirs\nSeems like there's always someone who disapproves\nThey'll judge it like they know about me and you\nAnd the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do\nThe jury's out, but my choice is you\nSo don't you worry your pretty little mind\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\nAnd life makes love look hard\nThe stakes are high, the water's rough\nBut this love is ours\nYou never know what people have up their sleeves\nGhosts from your past gonna jump out at me\nLurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles\nBut I don't care 'cause right now you're mine\nAnd you'll say\nDon't you worry your pretty little mind\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\nAnd life makes love look hard\nThe stakes are high, the water's rough\nBut this love is ours\nAnd it's not theirs to speculate\nIf it's wrong and\nYour hands are tough\nBut they are where mine belong and\nI'll fight their doubt and give you faith\nWith this song for you\n'Cause I love the gap between your teeth\nAnd I love the riddles that you speak\nAnd any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored\n'Cause my heart is yours\nSo don't you worry your pretty little mind\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\nAnd life makes love look hard\nDon't you worry your pretty little mind\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\nBut they can't take what's ours\nThey can't take what's ours\nThe stakes are high, the water's rough\nBut this love is ours\n---\nLast night I heard my own heart beating\nSounded like footsteps on my stairs\nSix months gone and I'm still reaching\nEven though I know you're not there\nI was playing back a thousand memories, baby\nThinking 'bout everything we've been through\nMaybe I've been going back too much lately\nWhen time stood still and I had you\nCome back come back, come back to me like\nYou would, you would if this was a movie\nStand in the rain outside 'til I came out\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\nYou could, you could if you just said you're sorry\nI know that we could work it out somehow\nBut if this was a movie you'd be here by now\nI know people change and these things happen\nBut I remember how it was back then\nLocked up in your arms and our friends are laughing\n'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them,\nNow I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street\nFlashback to the night when you said to me,\n'Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you,\nNot before I knew how much I had to lose.'\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\nYou would, you would if this was a movie\nStand in the rain outside 'til I came out\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\nYou could, you could if you just said you're sorry\nI know that we could work it out somehow\nBut if this was a movie you'd be here by now\nIf you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on,\nI've been waiting for you.\nEver since you've been gone\nI just want it back the way it was before.\nAnd I just wanna see you back at my front door.\nAnd I'd say come back, come back, come back to me like\nYou would before you said, 'It's not that easy.'\nBefore the fight, before I locked you out\nBut I take it all back now\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\nYou would, you would if this was a movie\nStand in the rain outside 'til I came out\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\nYou could, you could if you just said you're sorry\nI know that we could work it out somehow\nBut if this was a movie you'd be here by now\nYou'd be here by now\nIt's not the kind of ending you wanna see now\nBaby, what about the ending\nOh, I thought you'd be here by now, whoa\nThought you'd be here by now\n---\nTall, dark and superman\nHe puts papers in his briefcase and drives away\nTo save the world or go to work\nIt's the same thing to me\nHe's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition\nI wonder if he knows how much that I miss him\nI hang on every word you say, yay\nAnd you smile and say, 'How are you? '\nI say, 'Just fine'\nI always forget to tell you, I love you, I love you... forever\nI watch superman fly away\nYou've got a busy day today\nGo save the world, I'll be around\nI watch superman fly away\nCome back I'll be with you someday\nI'll be right here on the ground\nWhen you come back down\nTall, dark and beautiful\nHe's complicated, he's irrational\nBut I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah\nSomething in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'\nHe's not all bad like his reputation\nAnd I can't hear one single word they say\nAnd you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be OK\nI always forget to tell you I love you, I loved you from the very first day\nI watch superman fly away\nYou've got a busy day today\nGo save the world I'll be around\nI watch superman fly away\nCome back I'll be with you someday\nI'll be right here on the ground\nWhen you come back down\nAnd I watch you fly around the world\nAnd I hope you don't save some other girl\nDon't forget, don't forget about me\nI'm far away but I never let you go\nI'm lovestruck and looking out the window\nDon't forget, don't forget where I'll be\nRight here wishing the flowers were from you\nWishing the card was from you\nWishing the call was from you\n'Cause I loved you from the very first day\nI watch superman fly away\nYou've got a busy day today\nGo save the world, I'll be around...\nForever and ever here\nI watch superman fly away\nI swear I'll be with you someday\nI'll be right here on the ground\nWhen you come back down\n---\nI'm walking fast through the traffic lights\nBusy streets and busy lives\nAnd all we know\nIs touch and go\nWe are alone with our changing minds\nWe fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time\nAnd I never (never) saw you coming\nAnd I'll never (never) be the same\nYou come around and the armor falls\nPierce the room like a cannonball\nNow all we know is don't let go\nWe are alone, just you and me\nUp in your room and our slates are clean\nJust twin fire signs\nFour blue eyes\nSo you were never a saint\nAnd Ive loved in shades of wrong\nWe learn to live with the pain\nMosaic broken hearts\nBut this love is brave and wild\nAnd I never (never) saw you coming\nAnd I'll never (never) be the same\nThis is a state of grace\nThis is the worthwhile fight\nLove is a ruthless game\nUnless you play it good and right\nThese are the hands of fate\nYou're my Achilles heel\nThis is the golden age of something good and right and real\nAnd I never (never) saw you coming\nAnd I'll never (never) be the same\nAnd I never (never) saw you coming\nAnd I'll never (never) be the same\nThis is a state of grace\nThis is the worthwhile fight\nLove is a ruthless game\nUnless you play it good and right\n---\nLoving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street\nFaster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly\nLoving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall\nLike the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all\nLosing him was blue like I'd never known\nMissing him was dark grey all alone\nForgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met\nBut loving him was red\nTouching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you\nMemorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song\nFighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer\nRegretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong\nLosing him was blue like I'd never known\nMissing him was dark grey all alone\nForgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met\nBut loving him was red oh, red burning red\nRemembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes\nTell myself it's time now, gotta let go\nBut moving on from him is impossible\nWhen I still see it all in my head\nIn burning red\nBurning, it was red\nOh, losing him was blue like I'd never known\nMissing him was dark grey all alone\nForgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met\n'Cause loving him was red yeah, yeah, red\nWe're burning red\nAnd that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head\nComes back to me, burning red\nHis love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street\n---\nPut your lips close to mine\nAs long as they don't touch\nOut of focus, eye to eye\nTill the gravity's too much\nAnd I'll do anything you say\nIf you say it with your hands\nAnd I'd be smart to walk away,\nBut you're quicksand\nThis slope is treacherous\nThis path is reckless\nThis slope is treacherous\nAnd I, I, I like it\nI can't decide if it's a choice\nGetting swept away\nI hear the sound of my own voice\nAsking you to stay\nAnd all we are is skin and bone\nTrained to get along\nForever going with the flow,\nBut you're friction\nThis slope is treacherous\nThis path is reckless\nThis slope is treacherous\nAnd I, I, I like it\nTwo headlights shine through the sleepless night\nAnd I will get you, and get you alone\nYour name has echoed through my mind\nAnd I just think you should, think you should know\nThat nothing safe is worth the drive and I would\nFollow you, follow you home...\nI'll follow you, follow you home...\nThis hope is treacherous\nThis daydream is dangerous\nThis hope is treacherous\nTwo headlights shine through the sleepless night\nAnd I will get you, and get you alone\nYour name has echoed through my mind\nAnd I just think you should, think you should know\nThat nothing safe is worth the drive and I will\nFollow you, follow you home...\nI'll follow you, follow you home...\nThis slope is treacherous\nI, I, I like it\n---\nOnce upon a time a few mistakes ago\nI was in your sights, you got me alone\nYou found me, you found me, you found me\nI guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that\nAnd when I fell hard you took a step back\nWithout me, without me, without me\nAnd he's long gone when he's next to me\nAnd I realize the blame is on me\n'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in\nSo shame on me now\nFlew me to places I'd never been\n'Til you put me down, oh\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\nSo shame on me now\nFlew me to places I'd never been\nNow I'm lying on the cold hard ground\nOh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble\nNo apologies.

asking you,\nLast time I'm asking you this...\n---\nI was reminiscing just the other day,\nWhile having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away.\nBack to a first-glance feeling on New York Time.\nBack when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme.\nTook off faster than a green light 'Go'.\nYeah, you skipped the conversation when you already know.\nI left a note on the door with a joke wed made,\nAnd that was the first day.\nAnd darling, it was good never looking down.\nAnd right there where we stood was holy ground.\nSpinning like a girl in a brand new dress,\nWe had this big wide city all to ourselves.\nWe blocked the noise with the sound of I need you,\nAnd for the first time I had something to lose,\nAnd I guess we fell apart in the usual way.\nAnd the storys got dust on every page,\nBut sometimes I wonder how you think about it now.\nAnd I see your face in every crowd.\nCause darling, it was good never looking down.\nAnd right there where we stood was holy ground.\nTonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through.\nBut I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you.\nTonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room.\nBut I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you,\nIt was good never looking down.\nAnd right there where we stood was holy ground.\nTonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through.\nBut I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you.\nTonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room.\nBut I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you.\n---\nLong handwritten note deep in your pocket\nWords, how little they mean when you're a little too late\nI stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket\nGood girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait\nWe had a beautiful magic love there\nWhat a sad beautiful tragic love affair\nIn dreams I meet you in warm conversation\nWe both wake in lonely beds in different cities\nAnd time is taking its sweet time erasing you\nAnd you've got your demons, and, darling, they all look like me\n'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there\nWhat a sad beautiful tragic love affair\nDistance, timing, breakdown, fighting\nSilence, this train runs off its tracks\nKiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?\nHang up, give up, for the life of us we can't get back\nA beautiful magic love there\nWhat a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful\nWhat we had  a beautiful magic love there\nWhat a sad beautiful tragic love affair\nWe had a beautiful magic love there\nWhat a sad beautiful tragic love affair\n---\nNew to town with a made up name in the angel's city,\nChasing fortune and fame.\nAnd the camera flashes, make it look like a dream.\nYou had it figured out since you were in school.\nEverybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool.\nSo overnight you look like a sixties queen.\nAnother name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky.\nAnd theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.\nYeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.\nBut can you tell me now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh...\nNow its big black cars, and Riviera views,\nAnd your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you\nAnd your secrets end up splashed on the news front page.\nAnd they tell you that youre lucky.\nBut youre so confused,\n'Cause you dont feel pretty, you just feel used.\nAnd all the young things line up to take your place.\nAnother name goes up in lights. You wonder if youll make it out alive.\nAnd theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.\nYeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.\nCan you tell me now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.\nIt was a few years later, I showed up here.\nAnd they still tell the legend of how you disappeared,\nHow you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.\nThey say you bought a bunch of land somewhere,\nChose the Rose Garden over Madison Square,\nAnd it took some time, but I understand it now.\nCause now my name is up in lights, but I think you got it right,\nLet me tell you now, youre the lucky one.\nLet me tell you now, youre the lucky one.\nLet me tell you now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.\nYeah theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.\nYeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.\nAnd theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.\nOh, whoa, oh, oh\n---\nAll I knew this morning when I woke\nIs I know something now, know something now I didn't before.\nAnd all I've seen since eighteen hours ago\nIs green eyes and freckles and your smile\nIn the back of my mind making me feel like\nI just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now\nI just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now\nI just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now\nI just wanna know you, know you, know you\n'Cause all I know is we said, 'Hello.'\nAnd your eyes look like coming home\nAll I know is a simple name\nEverything has changed\nAll I know is you held the door\nYou'll be mine and I'll be yours\nAll I know since yesterday is everything has changed\nAnd all my walls stood tall painted blue\nAnd I'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you\n'Cause all I know is we said, 'Hello.'\nAnd your eyes look like coming home\nAll I know is a simple name\nEverything has changed\nAll I know is you held the door\nAnd you'll be mine and I'll be yours\nAll I know since yesterday is everything has changed\nCome back and tell me why\nI'm feeling like I've missed you all this time, oh, oh, oh.\nAnd meet me there tonight\nAnd let me know that it's not all in my mind.\nI just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now\nI just wanna know you, know you, know you\nAll I know is we said, 'Hello.'\nAnd your eyes look like coming home\nAll I know is a simple name\nEverything has changed\nAll I know is you held the door\nYou'll be mine and I'll be yours\nAll I know since yesterday is everything has changed]\nAll I know is we said, 'Hello.'\nSo dust off your highest hopes\nAll I know is pouring rain and everything has changed\nAll I know is a new found grace\nAll my days I'll know your face\nAll I know since yesterday is everything has changed\n---\nI said, 'Oh my, what a marvelous tune'\nIt was the best night, never would forget how he moved.\nThe whole place was dressed to the nines,\nAnd we were dancing, dancing\nLike we're made of starlight\nLike we're made of starlight\nI met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45\nPicked me up late one night out the window,\nWe were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild\nCan't remember what song it was playing when we walked in\nThe night we snuck into a yacht club party\nPretending to be a duchess and a prince\nAnd I said, 'Oh my, what a marvelous tune.'\nIt was the best night, never would forget how he moved.\nThe whole place was dressed to the nines,\nAnd we were dancing, dancing\nLike we're made of starlight, starlight\nLike we're made of starlight, starlight\nHe said, 'Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change.\nYou'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way.'\nHe was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me,\n'Don't you see the starlight, starlight?\nDon't you dream impossible things?'\nLike 'Oh my, what a marvelous tune.'\nIt was the best night, never would forget how he moved\nThe whole place was dressed to the nines,\nAnd we were dancing, dancing\nLike we're made of starlight, starlight\nLike we're made of starlight, starlight\nOoh ooh he's talking crazy\nOoh ooh dancing with me\nOoh ooh we could get married\nHave ten kids and teach them how to dream\nOh my, what a marvelous tune\nIt was the best night, never would forget how he moved\nThe whole place was dressed to the nines,\nAnd we were dancing, dancing\nLike we're made of starlight, starlight\nLike we're made of starlight, starlight\nLike we're made of starlight, starlight\nLike we dream impossible dreams\nLike starlight, starlight\nLike we dream impossible dreams\nDon't you see the starlight, starlight?\nDon't you dream impossible things?\n---\nTook a deep breath in the mirror\nHe didn't like it when I wore high heels But I do\nTurn the lock and put my headphones on\nHe always said he didn't get this song But I do, I do\nWalked in expecting you'd be late\nBut you got here early and you stand and wave\nI walk to you\nYou pull my chair out and help me in\nAnd you don't know how nice that is But I do\nAnd you throw your head back laughing like a little kid\nI think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did\nI've been spending the last eight months\nThinking all love ever does is break and burn and end\nBut on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again\nYou said you never met one girl\nWho had as many James Taylor records as you But I do\nWe tell stories and you don't know why\nI'm coming off a little shy But I do\nBut you throw your head back laughing like a little kid\nI think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did\nI've been spending the last eight months\nThinking all love ever does is break and burn and end\nBut on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again\nAnd we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up\nBut you start to talk about the movies that your family watches\nEvery single Christmas and I want to talk about that\nAnd for the first time what's past is past\n'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid\nI think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did\nI've been spending the last eight months\nThinking all love ever does is break and burn and end\nBut on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again\nBut on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again\n---\nYou should've been there,\nShould've burst through the door,\nWith that 'baby I'm right here' smile,\nAnd it would've felt like,\nA million little shining stars had just aligned,\nAnd I would've been so happy.\nChristmas lights glisten,\nI've got my eye on the door,\nJust waiting for you to walk in,\nBut the time is ticking,\nPeople ask me how I've been\nAs I comb back through my memory,\nHow you said you'd be here,\nYou said you'd be here.\nAnd it was like slow motion,\nStanding there in my party dress,\nIn red lipstick,\nWith no one to impress,\nAnd they're all laughing,\nAs I'm looking around the room,\nBut there's one thing missing,\nAnd that was the moment I knew.\nAnd the hours pass by,\nNow I just wanna be alone,\nBut your close friends always seem to know\nWhen there's something really wrong,\nSo they follow me down the hall,\nAnd there in the bathroom,\nI try not to fall apart,\nAnd the sinking feeling starts,\nAs I say hopelessly,\n'He said he'd be here.'\nAnd it was like slow motion,\nStanding there in my party dress,\nIn red lipstick,\nWith no one to impress,\nAnd they're all laughing,\nAnd asking me about you,\nBut there was one thing missing,\nAnd that was the moment I knew.\nWhat do you say\nWhen tears are streaming down your face\nIn front of everyone you know?\nAnd what do you do when the one\nWho means the most to you\nIs the one who didn't show?\nYou should've been here.\nAnd I would've been so happy.\nAnd it was like slow motion,\nStanding there in my party dress,\nIn red lipstick,\nWith no one to impress,\nAnd they're all standing around me singing\n'Happy birthday to you',\nBut there was one thing missing,\nAnd that was the moment I knew.\nYou called me later,\nAnd said, 'I'm sorry, I didn't make it,'\nAnd I said, 'I'm sorry too,'\nAnd that was the moment I knew.\n---\nYou said it in a simple way,\n4 AM, the second day,\nHow strange that I don't know you at all.\nStumbled through the long goodbye,\nOne last kiss, then catch your flight,\nRight when I was just about to fall\nI told myself, 'Don't get attached,'\nBut in my mind I play it back,\nSpinning faster than the plane that took you...\nAnd this is when the feeling sinks in,\nI don't wanna miss you like this,\nCome back... be here, come back... be here.\nI guess you're in New York today,\nI don't wanna need you this way,\nCome back... be here, come back... be here.\nThe delicate beginning rush,\nThe feeling you can know so much,\nWithout knowing anything at all.\nAnd now that I can't put this down,\nIf I had known what I'd known now,\nI never would have played so nonchalant.\nTaxi cabs and busy streets,\nThat never bring you back to me,\nI can't help but wish you took me with you...\nAnd this is when the feeling sinks in,\nI don't wanna miss you like this,\nCome back... be here, come back... be here.\nI guess you're in London today,\nI don't wanna need you this way,\nCome back... be here, come back... be here.\nThis is falling in love in the cruelest way,\nThis is falling for you when you are worlds away.\nNew York... be here.\nBut you're in London and I break down,\n'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.\nThis is when the feeling sinks in,\nI don't wanna miss you like this,\nCome back... be here, come back... be here.\nI guess you're in New York today,\nAnd I don't wanna need you this way,\nCome back... be here, come back... be here.\nI don't wanna miss you like this.\nCome back... be here.\nCome back... be here.\n---\nDon't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that,\nEverybody knows that,\nUh, uh\nDon't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that.\nI don't even know her,\nBut I feel a responsibility,\nTo do what's upstanding and right,\nIt's kinda like a code, yeah,\nAnd you've been getting closer and closer,\nAnd crossing so many lines.\nAnd it would be a fine proposition,\nIf I was a stupid girl,\nBut honey I am no-one's exception,\nThis I have previously learned.\nSo don't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that,\nEverybody knows that,\nUh, uh\nDon't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that,\nEverybody knows that,\nI see you turn off your phone,\nAnd now you got me alone,\nAnd I say,\nDon't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that,\nEverybody knows that.\nI just wanna make sure,\nYou understand perfectly,\nYou're the kind of man who makes me sad,\nWhile she waits up,\nYou chase down the newest thing,\nAnd take for granted what you have.\nAnd it would be a fine proposition,\nIf I was a stupid girl,\nAnd yeah I might go with it,\nIf I hadn't once been just like her.\nDon't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that,\nEverybody knows that,\nUh, uh\nDon't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that,\nEverybody knows that,\nI see you turn off your phone,\nAnd now you've got me alone,\nAnd I say,\nDon't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that,\nEverybody knows that.\nCall a cab,\nLose my number,\nYou're about to lose your girl,\nCall a cab,\nLose my number,\nLet's consider this lesson learned.\nDon't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that,\nEverybody knows that,\nDon't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that,\nEverybody knows that,\nWanna see you pick up your phone,\nAnd tell her you're coming home,\nDon't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that,\nEverybody knows that,\nDon't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that,\nEverybody knows that.\nIt would be a fine proposition,\nIf I hadn't once been just like her.\n---\n3 a.m. and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine\nFast asleep in your city that's better than mine\nAnd the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree\nAnd I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh\nWell, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles\nYeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love\nOh, they sit around talkin' 'bout the meaning of life\nAnd the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of\nBut now that we're done and it's over\nI bet you couldn't believe\nWhen you realized I'm harder to forget, than I was to leave\nAnd I bet you think about me\nYou grew up in a silver-spoon gated community\nGlamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills\nI was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion\nJust livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills\nBut you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for\nAnd you and I fell like an early spring snow\nBut reality crept in, you said we're too different\nYou laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes\nMr. Superior-Thinkin'\nDo you have all the space that you need?\nI don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy\nAnd I bet you think about me\nI bet you think about me, yes\nOoh, block it all out\nThe voices so loud sayin', 'Why did you let her go?'\nDoes it make you feel sad\nThat the love that you're lookin' for\nIs the love that you had?\nNow you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul\nScared not to be hip, scared to get old\nChasing make-believe status, last time you felt free\nWas when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me\nBut now that we're done and it's over\nI bet it's hard to believe\nBut it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave\nThen, yeah, I bet you think about me\nI bet you think about me, yes\nI bet you think about me when you're out\nAt your cool indie music concerts every week\nI bet you think about me in your house\nWith your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch\nI bet you think about me when you say\n'Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me'\nI bet you think about me\n---\nI know I’m probably better off on my own\nThan lovin' a man who\nDidn’t know what he had when he had it.\nAnd I see The permanent damage you did to me.\nNever again,\nI just wish I could forget when it was magic.\nI wish it wasn’t 4 am,\nStanding in the mirror, saying to myself:\nYou know you had to do it.\nI know the bravest thing I ever did was run. Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again\nBut I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man.\nAnd I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand\nAnd I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man,\nA better man.  \nI know I’m probably better off all alone\nThan needing a man who could\nChange his mind at any given minute.\nAnd it’s always on your terms\nI’m hanging on every careless word\nHoping it might turn sweet again\nLike it was in the beginning.\nBut your jealousy, I can hear it now.\nYou’re talking down to me like I’ll always be around.\nYou push my love away like it’s some kind of loaded gun.\nNo, you never thought I’d run.\nSometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again\nBut I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man.\nAnd I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand\nAnd I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man,\nA better man...\nI hold onto this pride\nBecause these days it’s all I have\nAnd I gave you my best,\nAnd we both know you can’t say that...\nNo, You can’t say that...\nIf you were a better man...\nYou would’ve been the one, If you were a better man,\nSometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again\nBut I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man.\nAnd I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand\nAnd I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man,\nA better man...\nWe might still be in love, if you were a better man,\n---\nI know that you like me\nAnd it's kinda frightenin'\nStanding here waitin', waitin'\nAnd I became hypnotized\nBy freckles and bright eyes\nTongue tied but now\nYou're so far away and I'm down\nFeelin' like a face in the crowd\nI'm reachin' for you, terrified\n'Cause you could be the one that I love\nI could be the one that you dream of\nMessage in a bottle is all I can do\nStandin' here, hopin' it gets to you\nYou could be the one that I keep, and I\nCan be the reason you can't sleep at night\nMessage in a bottle is all I can do\nStandin' here, hopin' it gets to you\nThese days I'm restless\nWork days are endless\nLook how you made me, made me\nBut time moves faster\nReplaying your laughter\nDisaster 'Cause now\nYou're so far away and I'm down\nFeelin' like a face in the crowd\nI'm reachin' for you, terrified\n'Cause you could be the one that I love\nI could be the one that you dream of\nMessage in a bottle is all I can do\nStandin' here, hopin' it gets to you (it gets to you)\nYou could be the one that I keep, and I (I)\nCan be the reason you can't sleep at night\nMessage in a bottle is all I can do\nStandin' here, hopin' it gets to you\nHow is it in London? (London)\nWhere are you while I'm wonderin' (wonderin')\nIf I'll ever see you again?\nYou could be the one that I love, mm-mm\nAnd now I'm standin' here, hopin' it gets to you\n'Cause you could be the one that I love\nI could be the one that you dream of\nMessage in a bottle is all I can do\nStandin' here, hopin' it gets to you (it gets to you)\nYou could be the one that I keep, and I\nCan be the reason you can't sleep at night (you can't sleep at night)\nMessage in a bottle is all I can do (yeah, yeah)\nStandin' here, hopin' it gets to you (yeah, yeah)\nYou could be the one that I love\nAnd now I'm standin' here, hopin' this gets to you\n---\nHe says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days\nHe says, 'Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?'\nHe spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be\nHe spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity\nI call just checkin' up on him\nHe's up, 3 AM pacin'\nHe says, 'It's not just a phase I'm in'\nMy voice comes out beggin'\nAll this time I didn't know\nYou were breakin' down\nI'd fall to pieces on the floor\nIf you weren't around\nToo young to know it gets better\nI'll be summer sun for you forever\nForever winter if you go\nHe seems fine most of the time, forcing smiles and neverminds\nHis laugh is a symphony, when the lights go out, it's hard to breathe\nI pull at every thread, tryna solve the puzzles in his head\nLive my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead\nI call just checkin' up on him\nHe's up, 5 AM wasted\nLong gone, not even listening\nMy voice comes out screamin'\nAll this time I didn't know\nYou were breakin' down\nI'd fall to pieces on the floor\nIf you weren't around\nToo young to know it gets better\nI'll be summer sun for you forever\nForever

every weekend, the same party\nI never go alone and I don't seem broken-hearted\nMy friends all say they know everything I'm going through\nI drive down different roads but they all lead back to you\n'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel\nThey weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell\nDidn't read the note on the Polaroid picture\nThey don't know how much I miss you\nI wish I could fly\nI'd pick you up and we'd go back in time\nI'd write this in the sky\nI miss you like it was the very first night\nAnd so it was, we never saw it comin'\nNot tryin' to fall in love, but we did like children runnin'\nBack then we didn't know we were built to fall apart\nWe broke the status quo, then we broke each other's hearts\nBut don't forget about the night out in L.A.\nDanced in the kitchen, chased me down through the hallway\nNo one knows about the words that we whispered\nNo one knows how much I miss you\nI wish I could fly\nI'd pick you up and we'd go back in time\nI'd write this in the sky\nI miss you like it was the very first night\nTake me away, take me away\nTake me away to you, to you\nI remember the night at the hotel\nI was ridin' in the car when we both fell\nI'm the one on the phone as you whisper\n'Do you know how much I miss you?'\nI wish that we could go back in time\nAnd I'd say to you\nI miss you like it was the very first night\nI wish I could fly\nI'd pick you up and we'd go back in time\nI'd write this in the sky\nI miss you like it was the very first night\ntake me away\n---\nWalking through a crowd\nThe village is aglow\nKaleidoscope of

it's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)\nI should just tell you to leave 'cause I\nKnow exactly where it leads but I\nWatch us go 'round and 'round each time\nYou got that James Dean daydream look in your eye\nAnd I got that red lip classic thing that you like\nAnd when we go crashing down, we come back every time\n'Cause we never go out of style\nWe never go out of style\nYou got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt\nAnd I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt\nAnd when we go crashing down, we come back every time\n'Cause we never go out of style\nWe never go out of style.\nSo it goes\nHe can't keep his wild eyes on the road\nTakes me home\nLights are off, he's taking off his coat, hmm, yeah.\nI say, 'I heard, oh, that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl.'\nHe says, 'What you've heard is true but I\nCan't stop thinking about you,' and I...\nI said, 'I've been there, too, a few times.'\n'Cause you got

simple\nWe were lying on your couch\nI remember\nYou took a Polaroid of us\nThen discovered (then discovered)\nThe rest of the world was black and white\nBut we were in screaming color\nAnd I remember thinking\nAre we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet?\nIn the clear yet?\nGood\nAre we out of the woods?\nLooking at it now\nLast December (last December)\nWe were built to fall apart\nThen fall back together (back together)\nYour necklace hanging from my neck\nThe night we couldn't quite forget\nWhen we decided (we decided)\nTo move the furniture so we could dance,\nBaby, like we stood a chance\nTwo paper airplanes flying, flying, flying\nAnd I remember thinkin'\nRemember when you hit the brakes too soon?\nTwenty stitches in the hospital room\nWhen you started cryin', baby, I did, too\nBut when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you\nRemember when we couldn't take the heat\nI walked out and said, 'I'm settin' you free,'\nBut the monsters turned out to be just trees\nAnd when the sun came up, you were lookin' at me\nYou were lookin' at me\nI remember, oh, I remember\n---\nPeople like you always want back the love they gave away\nAnd people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed\nThe more I think about it now the less I know\nAll I know is that you drove us off the road\nStay\nHey, all you had to do was stay\nHad me in the palm of your hand\nThen why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in\nStay, hey, now you say you want it\nBack now that it's just too late\nWell, it could've been easy\nAll you had to do was stay\nAll you had to do was stay\nHere you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say\nI've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made\nPeople like you always want back the love they pushed aside\nBut people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye\nStay\nHey, all you had to do was stay\nHad me in the palm of your hand\nThen why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in\nStay, hey, now you say you want it\nBack now that it's just too late\nWell, it could've been easy\nAll you had to do was stay\nLet me remind\nYou this was what you wanted\nYou ended it\nYou were all I wanted\nBut not like this\nOh, all you had to do was stay\nHey, all you had to do was stay\nHad me in the palm of your hand\nThen why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in\nStay, hey, now you say you want it\nBack now that it's just too late\nWell, it could've been easy\nAll you had to do was stay\nHey, all you had to do was stay\nHad me in the palm of your hand\nThen why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in\nStay, hey, now you say you want it\nBack now that it's just too late\nWell, it could've been easy\n---\nI stay out too late\nGot nothing in my brain\nThat's what people say, mmm-mmm\nThat's what people say, mmm-mmm\nI go on too many dates [chuckle]\nBut I can't make them stay\nAt least that's what people say, mmm-mmm\nThat's what people say, mmm-mmm\nBut I keep cruising\nCan't stop, won't stop

day he [x3]\n---\nFatefully I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me\nMisery Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep\nAnd you passed right by\nI was in the alley, surrounded on all sides\nThe knife cuts both ways\nIf the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break\nAnd I fell from the pedestal\nRight down the rabbit hole\nLong story short, it was a bad time\nPushed from the precipice\nClung to the nearest lips\nLong story short, it was the wrong guy\nNow I'm all about you\nI'm all about you, ah\nYeah, yeah I'm all about you, ah\nYeah, yeah\nActually I always felt I must look better in the rear view\nMissing me at the golden gates they once held the keys to\nWhen I dropped my sword\nI threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door\nAnd we live in peace\nBut if someone comes at us\nThis time, I'm ready\n'Cause I fell from the pedestal\nRight down the rabbit hole\nLong story short, it was a bad time\nPushed from the precipice\nClung to the nearest lips\nLong story short, it was the wrong guy\nNow I'm all about you\nI'm all about you, ah\nYeah, yeah I'm all about you\nNo more keepin' score now\nI just keep you warm (keep you warm)\nNo more tug of war now\nI just know there's more (know there's more)\nNo more keepin' score now\nI just keep you warm (keep you warm)\nAnd my waves meet your shore\nEver and evermore\nPast me I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things\nYour nemeses Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing\nAnd he's passing by\nRare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky\nAnd he feels like home\nIf the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go\nAnd I fell from the pedestal\nRight down the rabbit hole\nLong story short, it was a bad time\nPushed from the precipice\nClimbed right back up the cliff\nLong story short, I survived\n---\nHey Dorothea\nDo you ever stop and think about me?\nWhen we were younger\nDown in the park\nHoney, making a lark of the misery\nYou got shiny friends since you left town\nA tiny screen's the only place I see you now\nAnd I got nothing but well wishes for ya\nThis place is the same as it ever was\nBut you don't like it that way\nIt's never too late\nTo come back to my side\nThe stars in your eyes\nShined brighter in Tupelo\nAnd if you're ever tired of being known\nFor who you know\nYou know, you'll always know me\nDorothea (ah-ah) Dorothea (ah-ah)\nOoh, you're a queen\nSelling dreams\nSelling make up and magazines\nOoh, from you I'd buy anything\nHey Dorothea\nDo you ever stop and think about me?\nWhen it was calmer\nSkipping the prom\nJust to piss off your mom\nAnd her pageant schemes\nAnd damn, Dorothea\nThey all wanna be ya\nBut are you still the same soul\nI met under the bleachers?\nWell I guess I'll never know\nAnd you'll go on with the show\nBut it's never too late\nTo come back to my side\nThe stars in your eyes\nShined brighter in Tupelo\nAnd if you're ever tired of being known\nFor who you know\nYou know, you'll always know me\n---\nAnd the tennis court was covered up\nWith some tent-like thing\nAnd you asked me to dance\nBut I said, 'Dancing is a dangerous game'\nOh, I thought\nThis is gonna be one of those things\nNow I know\nI'm never gonna love again\nI've got some tricks up my sleeve\nTakes one to know one\nYou're a cowboy like me\nNever wanted love\nJust a fancy car\nNow I'm waiting by the phone\nLike I'm sitting in an airport bar\nYou had some tricks up your sleeve\nTakes one to know one\nYou're a cowboy like me\nPerched in the dark\nTelling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear\nLike it could be love\nI could be the way forward\nOnly if they pay for it\nYou're a bandit like me\nEyes full of stars\nHustling for the good life\nNever thought I'd meet you here\nIt could be love\nWe could be the way forward\nAnd I know I'll pay for it\nYou're a cowboy like me\nPerched in the dark\nTelling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear\nLike it could be love\nI could be the way forward\nOnly if they pay for it\nYou're a bandit like me\nEyes full of stars\nHustling for the good life\nNever thought I'd meet you here\nIt could be love\nWe could be the way forward\nAnd I know I'll pay for it\nAnd the skeletons in both our closets\nPlotted hard to mess this up\nAnd the old men that I've swindled\nReally did believe I was the one\nAnd the ladies lunching have their stories about\nWhen you passed through town\nBut that was all before I locked it down\nNow you hang from my lips\nLike the Gardens of Babylon\nWith your boots beneath my bed\nForever is the sweetest con\nI've had some tricks up my sleeve\nTakes one to know one\nYou're a cowboy like me\n---\nYou booked the night train for a reason\nSo you could sit there in this hurt\nBustling crowds or silent sleepers\nYou're not sure which is worse\nBecause I dropped your hand while dancing\nLeft you out there standing\nCrestfallen on the landing\nChampagne problems\nYour mom's ring in your pocket\nMy picture in your wallet\nYour heart was glass, I dropped it\nChampagne problems\nYou told your family for a reason\nYou couldn't keep it in\nYour sister splashed out on the bottle\nNow no one's celebrating\nDom Pérignon, you brought it\nNo crowd of friends applauded\nYour hometown skeptics called it\nChampagne problems\nYou had a speech, you're speechless\nLove slipped beyond your reaches\nAnd I couldn't give a reason\nChampagne problems\nYour Midas touch on the Chevy door\nNovember flush and your flannel cure\n'This dorm was once a madhouse'\nI made a joke, 'Well, it's made for me'\nHow evergreen, our group of friends\nDon't think we'll say that word again\nAnd soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls\nThat we once walked through\nOne for the money, two for the show\nI never was ready, so I watch you go\nSometimes you just don't know the answer\n'Til someone's on their knees and asks you\n'She would've made such a lovely bride\nWhat a shame she's fucked in her head, ' they said\nBut you'll find the real thing instead\nShe'll patch up your tapestry that I shred\nAnd hold your hand while dancing\nNever leave you standing\nCrestfallen on the landing\nWith champagne problems\nYour mom's ring in your pocket\nHer picture in your wallet\nYou won't remember all my\nChampagne problems\n---\nFriends break up, friends get married\nStrangers get born, strangers get buried\nTrends change, rumors fly through new skies\nBut I'm right where you left me\nMatches burn after the other\nPages turn and stick to each other\nWages earned and lessons learned\nBut I, I'm right where you left me\nHelp, I'm still at the restaurant\nStill sitting in a corner I haunt\nCross-legged in the dim light\nThey say, 'What a sad sight'\nI, I swear you could hear a hair pin drop\nRight when I felt the moment stop\nGlass shattered on the white cloth\nEverybody moved on\nI, I stayed there\nDust collected on my pinned-up hair\nThey expected me to find somewhere\nSome perspective, but I sat and stared\nRight where you left me\nYou left me no, oh, you left me no\nYou left me no choice but to stay here forever\nYou left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no\nYou left me no choice but to stay here forever\nDid you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?\nTime went on for everybody else, she won't know it\nShe's still 23 inside her fantasy\nHow it was supposed to be\nDid you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?\nBreak-ups happen every day, you don't have to lose it\nShe's still 23 inside her fantasy\nAnd you're sitting in front of me\nAt the restaurant, when I was still the one you want\nCross-legged in the dim light, everything was just right\nI, I could feel the mascara run\nYou told me that you met someone\nGlass shattered on the white cloth\nEverybody moved on\nHelp, I'm still at the restaurant\nStill sitting in a corner I haunt\nCross-legged in the dim light\nThey say, 'What a sad sight'\nI, I stayed there\nDust collected on my pinned-up hair\nI'm sure that you got a wife out there\nKids and Christmas, but I'm unaware\n'Cause I'm right where\nI cause no harm, mind my business\nIf our love died young, I can't bear witness\nAnd it's been so long\nBut if you ever think you got it wrong\n---\nWhen your dinner is cold and the chatter gets old\nYou ask for the tab\nOr that moment again, he's insisting that friends\nLook at each other like that\nWhen the words of a sister come back in whispers\nThat prove she was not in fact what she seemed\nNot a twin from your dreams\nShe's a crook who was caught\nThat old familiar body ache\nThe snaps from the same little breaks in your soul\nYou know when it's time to go\n20 years at your job\nThen the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours\nOr trying to stay for the kids\nWhen keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse\nThat old familiar body ache\nThe snaps from the same little breaks in your soul\nYou know when it's time to go\nSometimes giving up is the strong thing\nSometimes to run is the brave thing\nSometimes walking out is the one thing\nThat will find you the right thing\nSometimes giving up is the strong thing\nSometimes to run is the brave thing\nSometimes walking out is the one thing\nThat will find you the right thing\n15 years, 15 million tears\nBegging 'til my knees bled\nI gave it my all, he gave me nothing at all\nThen wondered why I left\nNow he sits on his throne in his palace of bones\nPraying to his greed\nHe's got my past frozen behind glass\nBut I've got me\nThat old familiar body ache\nThe snaps from the same little breaks in my soul\nI know when it's time to go\nSometimes giving up is the strong thing\nSometimes to run is the brave thing\nSometimes walking out is the one thing\nThat will find you the right thing\n---\nHoney, when I'm above the trees\nI see this for what it is\nBut now I'm right down in it\nAll the years I've given\nIs just shit we're dividing up\nShowed you all of my hiding spots\nI was dancing when the music stopped\nAnd in the disbelief\nI can't face reinvention\nI haven't met the new me yet\nThere'll be happiness after you\nBut there was happiness because of you\nBoth of these things can be true\nThere is happiness\nPast the blood and bruise\nPast the curses and cries\nBeyond the terror in the nightfall\nHaunted by the look in my eyes\nThat would've loved you for a lifetime\nLeave it all behind\nAnd there is happiness\nTell me, when did your winning smile\nBegin to look like a smirk?\nWhen did all our lessons start to look like weapons pointed at my deepest hurt?\nI hope she'll be a beautiful fool\nWho takes my spot next to you\nNo, I didn't mean that\nSorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury\nYou haven't met the new me yet\nThere'll be happiness after me\nBut there was happiness because of me\nBoth of these things I believe\nThere is happiness\nIn our history\nAcross our great divide\nThere is a glorious sunrise\nDappled with the flickers of light\nFrom the dress I wore at midnight\nLeave it all behind\nAnd there is happiness\nI can't make it go away by making you a villain\nI guess it's the price I pay for seven years in heaven\nAnd I pulled your body into mine every goddamn night now I get fake niceties\nNo one teaches you what to do\nWhen a good man hurts you\nAnd you know you hurt him too\nHoney, when I'm above the trees\nI see it for what it is\nBut now my eyes leak acid rain\nOn the pillow where you used to lay your head\nAfter giving you the best I had\nTell me what to give after that\nAll you want from me now\nIs the green light of forgiveness\nYou haven't met the new me yet\nAnd I think she'll give you that\nThere'll be happiness after you\nBut there was happiness because of you too\nBoth of these things can be true\nThere is happiness\nIn our history\nAcross our great divide\nThere is a glorious sunrise\nDappled with the flickers of light\nFrom the dress I wore at midnight\nLeave it all behind\nOh, leave it all behind\nLeave it all behind\nAnd there is happiness\n---\nIt's been a long time\nAnd seeing the shape of your name\nStill spells out pain\nIt wasn't right\nThe way it all went down\nLooks like you know that now\nYes, I got your letter\nYes, I'm doing better\nIt cut deep to know ya\nRight to the bone\nYes, I got your letter\nYes, I'm doing better\nI know that it's over\nI don't need your closure, your closure\nDon't treat me like some situation that needs to be handled\nI'm fine with my spite\nAnd my tears And my beers and my candles\nI can feel you smoothing me over\nYes, I got your letter\nYes, I'm doing better\nIt cut deep to know ya\nRight to the bone\nYes, I got your letter\nYes, I'm doing better\nI know that it's over\nI don't need your closure\nYour closure [x3]\nI know I'm just a\nWrinkle in your new life\nStaying friends\nWould iron it out so nice\nGuilty, guilty reaching out across the sea\nThat you put between you and me\nBut it's fake\nAnd it's oh so unnecessary\nYes, I got your letter\nYes, I'm doing better\nIt cut deep to know ya\nRight to the bone\nYes, I got your letter\nYes, I'm doing better\nI know that it's over\nI don't need your closure, closure [x3]\n---\nI'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night\nRough on the surface but you cut through like a knife\nAnd if it was an open-shut case\nI never would've known from that look on your face\nLost in your current like a priceless wine\nThe more that you say The less I know\nWherever you stray I follow\nI'm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans That's my man\nLife was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)\nHead on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in\nAs if you were a mythical thing\nLike you were a trophy or a champion ring\nAnd there was one prize I'd cheat to win\nThe more that you say The less I know\nWherever you stray I follow\nI'm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans That's my man\nYou know that my train could take you home\nAnywhere else is hollow\nI'm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans That's my man\nLife was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)\nThey count me out time and time again\nLife was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)\nBut I come back stronger than a 90's trend\nWait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark\nShow me the places where the others gave you scars\nNow this is an open-shut case\nGuess I should've known from the look on your face\nEvery bait and switch was a work of art\nThe more that you say The less I know\nWherever you stray I follow\nI'm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans That's my man\nYou know that my train could take you home\nAnywhere else is hollow\nI'm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans That's my man\nThe more that you say The less I know \nWherever you stray I follow\nBegging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans That's my man\nYou know that my train could take you home\nAnywhere else is hollow\nBegging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans That's my man\n---\nGleaming twinkling\nEyes like sinking ships\nOn waters so inviting\nI almost jump in\nBut I don't like a gold rush, gold rush\nI don't like anticipating my face in a red flush\nI don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch\nEverybody wants you\nEverybody wonders what it would be like to love you\nWalk past, quick brush\nI don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush\nI don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush\nEverybody wants you\nBut I don't like a gold rush\nWhat must it be like\nTo grow up that beautiful?\nWith your hair falling into place like dominos\nI see me padding 'cross your wooden floors\nWith my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door\nAt dinner parties\nI call you out on your contrarian shit\nAnd the coastal town\nWe wandered 'round had never\nSeen a love as pure as it\nAnd then it fades into the gray of my day old tea\n'Cause you know it could never be\n'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush\nI don't like anticipating my face in a red flush\nI don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch\nEverybody wants you\nEverybody wonders what it would be like to love you\nWalk past, quick brush\nI don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush\nI don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush\nEverybody wants you\nBut I don't like a gold rush\nWhat must it be like\nTo grow up that beautiful?\nWith your hair falling into place like dominoes\nMy mind turns your life into folklore\nI can't dare to dream about you anymore\nAt dinner parties\nWon't call you out on your contrarian shit\nAnd the coastal town\nWe never found will never\nSee a love as pure as it\n'Cause it fades into the gray of my day old tea\n'Cause it will never be\nGleaming twinkling\nEyes like sinking ships\nOn waters so inviting\nI almost jump in\n---\nI sit and watch you reading with your head low\nI wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed\nI sit and watch you\nI notice everything you do or don't do\nYou're so much older and wiser, and I\nI wait by the door like I'm just a kid\nUse my best colors for your portrait\nLay the table with the fancy sh-\nAnd watch you tolerate it\nIf it's all in my head, tell me now\nTell me I've got it wrong somehow\nI know my love should be celebrated\nBut you tolerate it\nI greet you with a battle hero's welcome\nI take your indiscretions all in good fun\nI sit and listen\nI polish plates until they gleam and glisten\nYou're so much older and wiser, and I\nI wait by the door like I'm just a kid\nUse my best colors for your portrait\nLay the table with the fancy sh-\nAnd watch you tolerate it\nIf it's all in my head, tell me now\nTell me I've got it wrong somehow\nI know my love should be celebrated\nBut you tolerate it\nWhile you were out building other worlds, where was I?\nWhere's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?\nI made you my temple, my mural, my sky\nNow I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life\nDrawing hearts in the byline\nAlways taking up too much space or time\nYou assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I\nI break free and leave us in ruins?\nTook this dagger in me and removed it?\nGain the weight of you then lose it\nBelieve me, I could do it\nIf it's all in my head tell me now\nTell me I've got it wrong somehow\nI know my love should be celebrated\nBut you tolerate it\n---\nNever be so kind, you forget to be clever\nNever be so clever, you forget to be kind\nAnd if I didn't know better\nI'd think you were talking to me now\nIf I didn't know better\nI'd think you were still around\nWhat died didn't stay dead\nWhat died didn't stay dead\nYou're alive, you're alive in my head\nWhat died didn't stay dead\nWhat died didn't stay dead\nYou're alive, so alive\nNever be so polite, you forget your power\nNever wield such power, you forget to be polite\nAnd if I didn't know better\nI'd think you were listening to me now\nIf I didn't know better\nI'd think you were still around\nWhat died didn't stay dead\nWhat died didn't stay dead\nYou're alive, you're alive in my head\nWhat died didn't stay dead\nWhat died didn't stay dead\nYou're alive, so alive\nThe autumn chill that wakes me up\nYou loved the amber skies so much\nLong limbs and frozen swims\nYou'd always go past where our feet could touch\nAnd I complained the whole way there\nThe car ride back and up the stairs\nI should've asked you questions\nI should've asked you how to be\nAsked you to write it down for me\nShould've kept every grocery store receipt\n'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me\nWatched as you signed your name Marjorie\nAll your closets of backlogged dreams\nAnd how you left them all to me\nWhat died didn't stay dead\nWhat died didn't stay dead\nYou're alive, you're alive in my head\nWhat died didn't stay dead\nWhat died didn't stay dead\nYou're alive, so alive\nAnd if I didn't know better\nI'd think you were singing to me now\nIf I didn't know better\nI'd think you were still around\n---\nGray November\nI've been down since July\nMotion capture\nPut me in a bad light\nI replay my footsteps on each stepping stone\nTrying to find the one where I went wrong\nWriting letters\nAddressed to the fire\nAnd I was catching my breath\nStaring out an open window\nCatching my death\nAnd I couldn't be sure\nI had a feeling so peculiar\nThat this pain would be for evermore\nHey December\nGuess I'm feeling unmoored\nCan't remember\nWhat I used to fight for\nI rewind the tape but all it does is pause\nOn the very moment all was lost\nSending signals\nTo be double crossed\nAnd I was catching my breath\nBarefoot in the wildest winter\nCatching my death\nAnd I couldn't be sure\nI had a feeling so peculiar\nThat this pain would be for evermore\nCan't not think of all the cost\nAnd the things that will be lost\nOh, can we just get a pause?\nTo be certain we'll be tall again\nWhether weather be the frost\nOr the violence of the dog days\nI'm on waves, out being tossed\nIs there a line that I could just go cross?\nAnd when I was shipwrecked (can't think of all the cost)\nI thought of you (all the things that will be lost now)\nIn the cracks of light (can we just get a pause?)\nI dreamed of you (to be certain we'll be tall again)\n(If you think of all the costs)\nIt was real enough (whether weather be the frost)\nTo get me through (or the violence of the dog days)\n(Out on waves being tossed)\nBut I swear (is there a line that we could just go cross?)\nYou were there\nAnd I was catching my breath\nFloors of a cabin creaking under my step\nAnd I couldn't be sure\nI had a feeling so peculiar\nThis pain wouldn't be for\n---\nHow's one to know?\nI'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones\nIn a faith forgotten land\nIn from the snow\nYour touch brought forth an incandescent glow\nTarnished but so grand\nAnd the old widow goes to the stone every day\nBut I don't, I just sit here and wait\nGrieving for the living\nOh, goddamn my pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand\nTaking mine, but it's been promised to another\nOh, I can't\nStop you putting roots in my dreamland\nMy house of stone, your ivy grows\nAnd now I'm covered in you\nI wish to know The fatal flaw that makes you long to be\nMagnificently cursed\nHe's in the room\nYour opal eyes are all I wish to see\nHe wants what's only yours\nOh, goddamn my pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand\nTaking mine, but it's been promised to another\nOh, I can't stop you putting roots in my dreamland\nMy house of stone, your ivy grows\nAnd now I'm covered\nClover blooms in the fields\nSpring breaks loose, the time is near\nWhat would he do if he found us out?\nCrescent moon, coast is clear\nSpring breaks loose, but so does fear\nHe's gonna burn this house to the ground\nHow's one to know?\nI'd live and die for moments that we stole\nOn begged and borrowed time\nSo tell me to run\nOr dare to sit and watch what we'll become\nAnd drink my husband's wine\nOh, goddamn My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand\nTaking mine, but it's been promised to another\nOh, I can't stop you putting roots in my dreamland\nMy house of stone, your ivy grows\nAnd now I'm covered in you\nAnd I'm covered in you\nSo yeah, it's a fire\nIt's a goddamn blaze in the dark\nAnd you started it. You started it\nSo yeah, it's a war\nIt's the goddamn fight of my life\nAnd you started it. You started it\nOh, I can't stop you putting roots in my dreamland\nMy house of stone, your ivy grows\nAnd now I'm covered\n---\nBreak my soul in two\nLooking for you but you're right here\nIf I can't relate to you anymore\nThen who am I related to?\nAnd if this is the long haul\nHow'd we get here so soon?\nDid I close my fist around something delicate?\nDid I shatter you?\nAnd I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island wondering where did my baby go?\nThe fast times, the bright lights, the merry go\nSorry for not making you my centerfold\nOver and over lost again with no surprises\nDisappointments, close your eyes\nAnd it gets colder and colder\nWhen the sun goes down\nThe question pounds my head\n'What's a lifetime of achievement?'\nIf I pushed you to the edge\nBut you were too polite to leave me\nAnd do you miss the rogue\nWho coaxed you into paradise and left you there?\nWill you forgive my soul\nWhen you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?\n'Cause we were like the mall before the Internet\nIt was the one place to be\nThe mischief, the gift wrapped suburban dreams\nSorry for not winning you an arcade ring\nOver and over lost again with no surprises\nDisappointments, close your eyes\nAnd it gets colder and colder\nWhen the sun goes down\nWere you waiting at our old spot\nIn the tree line by the gold clock\nDid I leave you hanging every single day?\nWere you standing in the hallway\nWith a big cake, happy birthday\nDid I paint your bluest skies the darkest gray?\nA universe away\nAnd when I got into the accident\nThe sight that flashed before me was your face\nBut when I walked up to the podium\nI think that I forgot to say your name\nI'm on a bench in Coney Island wondering where did my baby go?\nThe fast times, the bright lights, the merry go\nSorry for not making you my centerfold\nOver and over lost again with no surprises\nDisappointments, close your eyes\nAnd it gets colder and colder\nWhen the sun goes down, when the sun goes down\nThe sight that flashed before me was your face\nWhen the sun goes down\nBut I think that I forgot to say your name\nOver and over sorry for not making you my\nMaking you my, making you my centerfold\n---\n"
